<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter3</span> Portuguese Ecosystem</h1>
<p>Many studies carried on this type of investment in Portugal, usually choose to analyse a given particular case or take the data of all investment in venture capital, i.e., âprivate equityâ and âventure capitalâ. As will be shown below, private equity investment is significantly predominant, both concerning the amount and number of transactions carried out.</p>
<p>Considering that it wouldnât be idoneous to assume the behavior of all venture capital and private equity investment, for the subcategory of venture capital, and secondly to look at an extended period of time (in reverse of a single year); several data was extracted (seeking use reliable sources) to build a report on the ecosystem of this type of investment.</p>
<p>As already announced earlier, several assumptions are substantially different from the Portuguese system. To assert that one variable influences another, it requires an exercise of seeking data to infer any conclusion or even the impossibility of inferring.</p>
<p>Thus, at an early stage it will be to examine various data intended to characterise the ecosystem in general (using the business indicators from INE), then will be looked for the subset of the entire venture capital and Private Equity. Finally to the particular case of venture capital built through different sources. Starting from a general plan to intermediate and, at last, micro.</p>
<p>The aim is to introduce the different dimensions of the object and the actors under study, over time, in order to, on the one hand, contextualise, and on the other, present sources where the data collection focused on the subject and actors under review (Portuguese) and use of the national ecosystem data in order to better understand the problems and limitations. In fact, more than the solution to a given question, the question or hypothesis that is formulated, the data they use and the method turn out to be more important. The solution, in the end, corresponds only to the result of the equation and chosen variables.</p>

<p>Between 2007 and 2015, the following events stand out:</p>
<p><strong>Internal</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Law 62-A/2008, of November 11 - Nationalises all the shares representing the share capital of Banco PortuguÃªs de NegÃ³cios, SA, and approves the legal regime of public appropriation through nationalisation.</p></li>
<li><p>On April 6, 2011, the Portuguese Government sent a request for financing to the European Commission, following the deterioration of the public debt financing capacity (almost 6% to 1 year, in which, in the secondary market, the five-year debt negotiated above the 10%, while the interest demanded by investors for 10-year Treasury bonds was close to 9%).</p></li>
<li><p>Another important fact to note is that during the period from May 2011 to May 2014, Portugal was under a bailout program signed with the IMF, EU and ECB, âMemorandum of Understanding on Economic Policy Conditionalitiesâ, which had for one side, deficit restrictions and, on the other hand, aimed to restructuring sectors in order to increase competitiveness.</p></li>
<li><p>Resolution Fund was created by Decree-Law no. 31-A/2012, of February 10, which introduced a resolution regime in the General Regime of Credit Institutions and Financial Companies, approved by Decree-Law No. 298/92, of December 31.</p></li>
<li><p>On August 3, 2014, the Board of Directors of Banco de Portugal decided to apply a resolution to Banco EspÃ­rito Santo, S.A. The generality of the activity and assets of Banco EspÃ­rito Santo, S.A. was transferred, immediately and definitively, to Novo Banco, duly capitalised and expurgated of problematic assets. Deposits would be fully preserved, as well as all non-subordinated bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>On 20 December 2015 - Communication from the Bank of Portugal on the sale of Banif - Banco Internacional do Funchal, SA, âThe operation involves an estimated public support of â¬ 2 255 million to cover future contingencies, â¬ 489 million of which Resolution Fund and â¬ 1,766 million directly by the State, as a result of the options agreed between the Portuguese authorities, the European bodies and Banco Santander Totta, to delimit the perimeter of assets and liabilities to be divested.â</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>External</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers, one of the largest US banks, announced the bankruptcy, with a debt of $700 billion. The Dow jumped 504.48 points, the highest since September 17, 2001.</li>
<li>Sovereign debt crisis (2009-2012): From the end of 2009 and early 2010, some eurozone countries began to have difficulties in financing their debts. The uncertainty of the markets began by making the normal public debt issuance operations costly and ultimately rendering them unsustainable.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> The Portuguese business fabric</h3>
<p>A âstartupâ is first and foremost a company (in a broad sense), which its aim is the pursuit of profit, usually in the form of a commercial company. Considering the data collected and processed by the INE âMain Economic and Patrimonial Indicators of Companies in Portugalâ, illustrated are several indicators for the reporting period (from 2004 to 2014, i.e., until the last series available).</p>
<p>Before understanding what distinguishes this type of companies from the other, it is considered important to know on the one hand the demographics, as the balance sheets indicators, on the whole.</p>
<p>Although the acquisition and transfer of businesses can be made through the direct acquisition âtrespasseâ, the instant case is under investment through the so-called âindirect participationâ, i.e., of the shares in a commercial company.</p>

<p>Of the total number of companies, the majority do not have economic activity usually known as âhigh growthâ, in particular the activities that comprise the sections: (i) C - Manufacturing (ie the production of goods); (ii) Information and communication activities (this section includes activities related to the production of software, web and others); and (iii) M - Scientific, technical and similar consultancy activities (in this section are also Development and Research (R&amp;D) activities, as well as engineering and other sciences). The information and communication activities are a small part of the total, and no significant change in the relative number of companies is visible.</p>
<p>Considering the rate of renewal, the main indicators are the number of births and number of deaths.</p>

<p>By analysing these 3 economic activities, it is apparent that stands the net incorporation of companies with Scientific and technical activities and, on the other hand, significant destruction (as compared to the other) companies with manufacturing activities, over the period (i.e.Â the value below 0 on the horizontal axis).</p>

<p>Using the year 2010, as base year, it was calculated the survival rate (percentage) in which:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>These three classes perform better than the totality over all periods;</p></li>
<li><p>Of these three, the one that has a worse survival rate are those related to Information Activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Of the total number of companies created, at the end of 4 years, approximately 60% survives (overall), with those in the Industry sector having a higher survival rate of 70%.</p></li>
<li><p>On the contrary, 40% does not survive and there is a high percentage that does not survive. It is important to keep this in mind when it is considered extinct (by liquidation, by the initiative of the shareholders, or due to insolvency).</p></li>

<p>One of the important conclusions is that, considering the financial ratios described:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>In general terms, companies are financed mainly from non equity instruments:</p></li>
<li><p>These have a reduced financial autonomy and part of it is financed through non-equity non-equity capital. There has not been a significant change since 2004, only changes in the solvency ratio are visible, with the remaining stable over time.</p></li>

<p>Considering that most companies are SMEs, disaggregating and comparing by size, SMEs have results (net) worse than the whole of the companies. A contrario, most of the population (SMEs) do not have results similar to the whole, i.e.Â there is a fraction (large companies), which significantly alter the overall results.</p>

<p>Overall, a decrease in the debt to equity ratio is visible, particularly from 2010.</p>
<p>Whereas:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Assets = Liabilities + Equity\)</span>, and;</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Equity = Share\, Capital + Reserves + Retained\,Earnings\)</span>,</p>
<p>an increase in the debt (numerator) with the absence or decrease of retained positive results (affecting the denominator) may result deterioration of this ratio. On the basis of the concept that companies finance their activities through equity or debt, in the event of a deterioration in the economic activity, by not generating or producing sufficient resources to sustain economic activity and/or companies without accumulated surpluses, will only be able to resort to greater indebtedness to finance this deficit. Another restriction may be on the offer of funds, or the conditions (e.g.Â the interest rate, the guarantees required for credit approval) to which these funds are offered.</p>

<p>In absolute terms, a deterioration of total assets is visible, but the percentage ratio between asset financing remained stable over the period. Whereas the assets includes everything that the company has and is likely to be assessed in cash - cash balances (in cash, bank deposits and marketable securities), customerâs credit, goods, equipment, facilities, etc., a reduction is visible accentuated since 2008.</p>
<p>As a point of reference, the variable âGeneral Assetsâ, which corresponds to the âAssetâ in Chart 18 of the above companies, was added.</p>

<p>In the case of Scientific and technical and activities, it is visible a sustained increase since 2004.</p>
<p>It can thus be concluded that these companies in these three economic activities have a structure of the balance sheet, with different behavior of the whole of the companies.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2.2</span> High-Growth Companies and High-Growth young Companies âGazellesâ</h4>
<p>According to the INE methodological notes, are:</p>
<p><strong>High-growth enterprises</strong> - Companies (with 10 or more paid employees) with an average annual growth of more than 10% over a three-year period, growth being measured in terms of the number of paid employees</p>
<p><strong>High growth young enterprises</strong> - Companies (with 10 or more paid people) up to 5 years of age with an average annual growth of more than 10% over over a three-year period, growth being measured in terms of the number of paid employees (Gazelles).</p>
<p>Considering the object of study and after analysing the composition, in general terms and in the overall Portuguese business fabric, it is important to question:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Relative percentage of companies that fall into one of the two classifications, that is, comparatively there are many or few companies with these traits?</p></li>
<li><p>It was added companies with 10 or more paid people to serve as a midpoint.</p></li>

<p>Whereas in both cases of high-growth companies, it has a requirement to have more than 10 persons employed, of the 39 648 existing only 3415 meet the cumulatively with the requirement âwith an average annual growth exceeding 10% over a period of 3 yearsâ. If added the requirement âup to 5 years of ageâ, only 343 meet the requirements to be considered âhigh growth young companiesâ.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate the proportion of those who fulfill these requirements, the number of companies was placed in the bar Chart below, in absolute terms.</p>

<p>Considering high-growth enterprises and high-growth young enterprises, it has been broken down by economic activity and, unlike the general scenario, where information and communication activities are a small part, as mentioned above, in this group the manufacturing activities , Scientific, technical and similar consultancy activities and information and communication activities makes up more than half of that has these attributes, in which, considering the year 2014, manufacturing has over almost 1/3 of so-called high-growth companies (1075 a total of 3415). The other two classes have 184 (Professional, scientific and technical activities) and 152 (information and communication activities).</p>

<p>The same can be observed in young high growth companies, out of a total of 343 (2014), 103 are under Manufacturing economic activities, 22 Scientific and Technical activities and only 13 Information and Communication activities.</p>
<p>As will be analysed later, this data contrast with the number of companies (by economic activity) that had venture capital financing. That is, it is considered that the companies related to digital services, programming (which fall into the section J - Information and communication services) would be those that would have better performance, but in comparison, are the manufacturing ones, where there are more occurrences. On the other hand, since 2008 (or since there is data), the maximum number of companies in this section has always been less than 20, reaching its peak in 2010. On the other hand 2011, as will be seen below, due to availability of funds through public risk sharing instruments, was the year in which more venture capital funds were set up, as the type of companies that invested the most.</p>

<p>The decision to start, or not an economic activity, depends on the will of the agents, that is, the perception that the agent has of the opportunity and the possibility (or probability) of being successful.</p>
<p>The following Qualitative Business Indicators were considered from January 2004 to December 2015:</p>

<p>Although with similar behavior to the economic climate indicator, the information and communication activities, which until 2011 had better results (red line), one notes the sharp drop from 2011, in which it has results are similar to the whole, as it is visible in with consultancy activities.</p>
<p>However, the recovery from 2013 onwards is not accompanied by Information Activities which, even at the end of 2015, shows the worst evaluation, i.e.Â a complete reversal of what was visible between 2004 and 2011.</p>
<p>For Manufacturing Industry (blue line) the assessment was more negative in 2008 than in 2011 (compared with the other two indicators) and during 2011 the drop is less pronounced, in which also has improved .</p>

On the other hand, in 2016 entered Sonae Capital, Corticeira Amorim and Montepio, but they still have less than 20 companies (18) of listed companies.</p>
<p>In percentage terms, only signed two peaks in 2000 and 2008, both with a marked fall in line with what happened with other exchanges, after the bubble dot com (2000) and the fall of Lehman and subsequent sovereign debt crisis (2012) .</p>

<p>In the case of onerous transfers carried out in the course of merger operations, when no shares are allocated to the partner of the merged company, a capital gain or loss of shares is deemed to be the positive or negative difference, respectively, between the value of market share capital of the merged company on the date of the transaction and the acquisition value of the equity shares held by shareholders of the merged company.</p>

<p>Venture Capital Fund â FCR (Article 23.Âº) - Exempt from IRC are incomes obtained by a FCR established and operated according to the domestic laws. Income from participating units paid or made available to the respective owners either by distribution or redemption shall be taxed by way of withholding at source under IRS and IRC at a 10 per cent rate, provided that the holders of such income are entities exempted from capital income or non-resident entities with no permanent establishment in the Portuguese territory to which the income is attributable;</p>
<p>Shareholding management companies (SGPS), Venture Capital Companies (SCR) and Venture Capital Investors (ICR) (Article 32) - Exemption of dividends received from controlled companies by way of the application of the regime for elimination of economic double taxation as provided for under the IRC Code, regardless of any requirement in respect of the percentage or the participating value. Capital gains and capital losses realised by a SGPS, SCR or a ICR from the corporate rights held by them (provided that they are held for at least one year) and from financial charges borne on the acquisition thereof shall not be considered as forming part of the taxable profit of these companies. The SCR and ICR may deduct from the amount ascertained for IRC purposes and up to the amount thereof, an amount corresponding to the limit of the total amount of the IRC taxable amounts of the five taxable periods preceding that to which the benefit refers, provided that such amount is used as investment in companies with a high potential of increase and improvement. The deduction is carried out in respect of the IRC assessment for the accounting period in which the investments were made or, in case of insufficiency of assessed income, up to the end of the five subsequent accounting periods;</p>
<p>This regime establishes the possibility for VC Firms to deduct the tax until their competition, limited to the sum of IRC from the previous five years, provided that this amount is invested in companies with potential for growth and appreciation. This deduction must be made in the year in which the investments are realized or, when it can not be fully, in the liquidation of the following five years.</p>
<p>However, potential losses, as they do not fall within the tax deductible provisions, are also not relevant to the formation of the referred profit. Thus, the taxation of these gains (or deduction of losses) occurs only in the year in which the gain (capital loss) be realized by the sale of shareholding and only if there are no requirements that allow the exemption (non-deduction) Of this income (Participation Exemption Regime).</p>
<p>Compared to the US and the UK, besides the capital gains tax and the exemptions described (and corresponding non deduction in the case of losses), there is also the corporate tax rate of companies subject to investment.</p>
<p>Although financing costs are considered at a cost to company, other factors seem to be more relevant, such as the investment policy of the funds (i.e.Â the eligibility of the use of debt instruments), the risk of bankruptcy and the possibility of repayment (Or liquidity preference).</p>
<p>Moreover the forms of compensation (or often used as promotional incentives the management of these funds) used in other systems, such as cases of âratchetâ (a breakdown of return on capital invested in a company between the fund and the management) or âCarried interestâ (the managementâs share of the fund, usually 20% of the net profit realized by the fund during its useful life), has no specific or special treatment in IRS or IRC.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.6</span> Corporate governance and investor protection</h3>
<p>One of the important factors for investment, particularly in companies with a high level of risk, is the corporate governance and investor protection.</p>
<p>As indicated in the previous paragraph, will be analysed, including issues relating to investor partner, as the rights of shareholders and the limits of certain provisions, such as the penalty clauses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of the key components in any corporate governance system is transparency (or disclosure of information). Without this it is not possible to monitor managers and, consequently, to induce changes in management (essential shareholdersâ right).</p>
<p>In addition to internal monitoring by shareholders, external monitoring, by creditors and the system in general, provides a better and appropriate tool for issues such as risk analysis (e.g., lenders), reduction of opportunistic behaviour of management compensation decisions), equal treatment of potential investors (particularly in the market).</p>
<p>Unlike the United Kingdom, where there is a further development of corporate governance principles in Portugal, these practices are only visible in more consolidated and larger companies.</p>
<p>For example, the provision of paragraph 2 of Article 70 of the Companies Code, concerning the duty of accountability, as it provides that âthe company shall make available to interested parties free of charge on its Internet site, if any, and in its headquarters a full copyânamely the Management Report the Report on the structure and practices of corporate governance, and the legal Certification of the accounts. Removing the case of listed companies and the Government, the cases that have âInternet siteâ and these documents will be available rare<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Contrast, with the United Kingdom, that already in 1991 creates a commission that gives shape to the Cadbury Report, which contained recommendations for a better Corporate Governance. This is just one of the contrasting examples in which there is self-regulation<a href="#fn16" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> (through guilds, professional orders), to protect âtrustâ in the market, without dependence or needs to have a legislative act to create and define these duties of conduct.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="social-risk-aversion-and-bankruptcy" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Social (risk aversion and bankruptcy)</h2>
<p>One of the features that most distinguishes the Anglo Saxon system, from the Portuguese (or opposition from continental Europe), seems to be the way it is perceived and understood the risk, as well as bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Max Weber<a href="#fn17" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>, in âThe Protestant Ethic and theâ Spirit âof Capitalismâ (in the German original Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus) investigates the relationship between a certain form of economic conduct and its religious roots. One of the conclusions is the way âworkâ is seen or those who succeed because of work. As opposed to in countries with Catholic roots, there is an idea of equality and the virtue of âpovertyâ.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the issue of pre-pack procedures (insolvency), these systems seem to allow for more flexibility in opening and closing companies, thus less inefficient businesses in the system, which compensate with more âaccountabilityâ<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> and surveillance. On the other hand, it is faster to solve these inefficiencies, as opposed to a more guaranteed system, like the continental ones.</p>
<div id="historical-perspective" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Historical perspective</h3>
<p>In the field of law, it is common to define 3 essential changes for the development of companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of public companies (or joint stock companies);</li>
<li>Freedom of establishment / incorporation;</li>
<li>The limitation of liability;</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of Stock Public Companies, it is also important to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulation concerning information duties (in particular if sold to the general public, appearing to protect investors, usually in response to financial crises);</li>
<li>Regulation of competition (notably in the context of mergers and acquisitions) where, unlike Europe, the freedom of private enterprise is established in contrast to the companies that were granted monopolies in Europe.<a href="#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the mechanisms and investment vehicles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulation of the trust (namely in the United Kingdom);</li>
<li>Regulation of the investment vehicles (type of assets and the fiduciary duties that are attached);</li>
</ul>
<p>Can thus consider three-time series, the first phase, intrinsically linked to the commercial monopoly, a second phase, linked essentially to the Industrial Revolution and a third, beginning after World War II.</p>
<p>Unlike other countries (with the same development of the âEnterpriseâ), Portugal did not find a great production of systematic norms (except for sparse rules), and there is no autonomisation of commercial law from private law. As Coutinho de Abreu points out,<a href="#fn20" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> âcommercial law is considered globally special (not exceptional - although it contains exceptional rules). It is a legal branch with rules different from those of ordinary law, applicable only to certain subjects, objects and relations - but without excluding the applicability of civil law as common and subsidiary law.â</p>
<p>On the other hand the commercial law is rooted, in international trade treaties as well as the uses and customs features rules; the principle of credit enhancement (insolvency risk), protection of legitimate expectations (bookkeeping duties and publicity); (Eg freedom of form and rapid transfer of securities) and the presumption of charges (for example, the mandate), the application of the solidarity regime in commercial obligations (Article 100.Âº of the Commercial Code) , Commercial interest (legal or conventional, remuneration, interest over principal) and arrears (reparation or compensation) are due, in the cases provided for in the CSC. Unlike the CC not previse interest (reduced in writing) is applied complementarily to paragraph 1 legal rate of 2 C Commercial art.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Timeline of major changes throughout history</h3>
<p>A timeline was drawn up, with major legislative changes and relevant facts (notably when many of the norms are born in response to a particular situation, such as market bubbles) not only from Portugal, but from England and the Netherlands (where The first manifestations of regulation of the company with its capital divided by shares are visible), the US (where many of the tools are inspired) and the EU (from which emanate many of the rules now into force).</p>
<p>Much of the literature in law, opt to make comparison and contextualisation with closest jurisdictions (notably the German, Italian or Lex Mercatoria<a href="#fn21" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> for more distant periods). In Corporate Finance, many of the studies are based on observations in markets such as American or English.

<div id="context-and-historical-background-of-the-creation-of-the-first-public-limited-companies" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Context and historical background of the creation of the first public limited companies</h3>
<p>The English East India Company (later called British East India Company), East India Company, was a royal company formed by London merchants in 1600, with the name âCompany of Merchants of London Trading to the East Indiesâ, whom queen Elizabeth I granted a monopoly on the tea trade of the âEast Indiesâ for a period of 15 years. The Dutch East India Company or the Company Dutch East India formally United East India Company (Dutch, âVereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnieâ with the VOC acronym) was a real company formed by the Dutch, in 1602 - two years later of the formation of the English East India Company - with the aim of trying to exclude competition from other European companies from that important trade route.</p>
<p>The headquarters were in Amsterdam, where the Bank of Amsterdam was created in 1609 to support colonial trade. It is in this financial dynamic created by the Dutch company that the current concept of shares (aktien) will arise through the division of its equity into equal and transferable shares. However, due to the good results, it will become increasingly a nationalized agency with military authority and military power to administer or enforce its rights and claims in the seas. Taxes on goods and rent were a significant source of revenue for the Dutch state.</p>
<p>After the IV Anglo-Dutch War (1780-1784), the VOC began to have financial problems and was liquidated in 1799. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Dutch East Indies were officially transferred to the Dutch crown.</p>
<p>East India Company, which was dissolved in 1874 (after frequent government interventions and with constant financial problems), through the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act approved a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the case of England it was possible to set up companies, but they depended on administrative authorization (Act of Parliament or Royal Charter), where a certain monopoly was guaranteed in a certain territory, as in the case of the East India Company and with the advent of the stock market and Stock market brought new complexities of business organizations.</p>
<p>Already Adam Smith, analising the Public Limited Companies of his time, wrote: âThis total exemption from risk, beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint stock companies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery.â<a href="#fn23" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>For example, in 1711, with the creation of the South Sea Company, a joint stock company. It has assumed the liabilities of England, which had resulted from the War of Spanish Succession. In return, a monopoly was given to trade in colonies, in South America of Spain. There was great speculation about the value of the company and, this speculation ultimately resulted in an economic bubble, the South Sea Bubble of 1720, which caused the financial ruin for many investors. In order to control this speculation, the British Parliament approved the âBubble Actâ of 1720, prohibiting all joint stock companies unauthorized by a royal charter. Throughout this process of corporate evolution, the nature of management has shifted from âa communion of personal knowledge to that of an impersonal collective.â and âA fellowship of personal acquaintances to that of an impersonal collective.â</p>
<p>The ban on setting up businesses without a Royal Charter of Bubble Act 1720 remained until 1824.</p>
<p>With the industrial revolution restrictions were gradually withdrawn, namely from incorporation, in order to facilitate the pursuit of commercial activity.</p>
<p>Through the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, it was possible through a mere registration process (not so dependent on administrative or royal authorization) to establish a company, which had all the rights and obligations related to commercial activity and all shareholders and investors could articulate their corporate relationships. In 1855 the limitation of liability was introduced through the Limited Liability Act 1855, which brought the benefit of limitation of liability to investors in the event of bankruptcy of the company. These two measures were subsequently gathered in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856, and it is now in force the Companies Act 2006.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3.1</span> Portugal</h4>
<p>As far as continental law (or as opposed to common law) countries are concerned, it was only in 1807 that the French Commercial Code provided for corporations, where their constitution was also subject to government authorization. In Portugal, the Commercial Code 1833, provided similar authorization (requiring administrative recognition) for these companies.</p>
<p>Only in 1867 (with the Law of 22 June 1867) which was regulated for the first time in Portugal, the public limited company, with individual freedom of establishment, subsequently amended and incorporated into the Commercial Code 1888 passing from 1986, to be regulated by the Commercial Companies Code (CSC).</p>
<p>With the emergence of finance capital and freedom of establishment of corporations, as on the other hand there are conditions for allocating surpluses in others assets, combined with the limitation of liability, as the very creation of the Stock Exchange (in 1891 the porto and Lisbon 1901), ie creating liquidity for the trading of these assets, the conditions were created for larger scale business financing market, which were impossible if you only depended on equity of shareholders âbusinessman.â</p>
<p>Thus originates what is still referred to as business or majority shareholders and investor shareholders. As in the British case, the dispersion of capital and the separation between the management of the company and the owners of capital, brought an increasing complexity of the management of companies, today this phenomenon is referred to as âagency problemâ.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3.2</span> Present</h4>
<p>Many authors define the American Research and Development Corporation (ARD)<a href="#fn24" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> as the first venture capital firm.<a href="#fn25" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Given the potential of this project, the US government created the Small Business Investments Companies Administration (SIBCA), which, when managing a set of tax benefits and subsidized credits, was created by Georges Doriot, Ralph Flanders and Karl Compton, enabled the development of the venture capital industry.</p>
<p>The establishment of companies in what is now known as âSilicon Valleyâ and its constructions has as one of its precursor Fairchild Semiconductor. The history of Fairchild passes through the establishment of another institution, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories in Santa Clara Valley in 1955.</p>
<p>In 1957, Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Eugene Kleiner, Jean Hoerni, Jay Last, Gordon Moore,<a href="#fn26" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Robert Noyce and Sheldon Roberts created the Fairchild Semiconductor and later developed the functional integrated circuit (in 1961), being considered one of the most significant inventions. Not only for the area, but also for the creation of technological companies (or what is now known as âstartupsâ).</p>
<p>They consider that one of the first successes of this new form of investment was in 1957 with the investment in the Digital Equipment Corporation, in which in 1966, the investors get return equivalent to several multiples of the capital invested through the Public Offer of Acquisition launched by this one.</p>
<p>From this company, other derivatives are born, such as Intel (founded by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce) in 1968. In the 1970s, (until the 1987 crash) created what is now called private equity<a href="#fn27" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>, originally in the US.</p>
<div id="portugal-until-nowdays" class="section level5">
<h5><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3.2.1</span> Portugal until nowdays</h5>
<p>In Portugal, in addition to issues related to the regime that was in force until 1974, the first similar operations were carried out through âbusiness developmentâ funds, in particular through the so-called âRestructuring and Enterprise Internationalization Fundsâ<a href="#fn28" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> (fundos de reestruturaÃ§Ã£o e internacionalizaÃ§Ã£o empresarial, FRIE). The development of Venture Capital originated from public venture capital frameworks:<a href="#fn29" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> created in 1986 as a measure of Programa EspecÃ­fico de Desenvolvimento de IndÃºstria PortuguÃªs 1 (PEDIP 1), in which funds were distributed through the Instituto de Apoio Ã s Pequenas e MÃ©dias Empresas (IAPMEI) to two venture capital companies, Norpedip (PME Capital) and Sulpedip (PME Investimentos), created in 1999 and both owned by the the State.</p>
<p>The PEDIP 1 was followed by PEDIP 2 for the period from 1994 to 2000. During the PEDIP 2, in order to stimulate private investment activity, government programs put the Structural Funds of the European Union (EU) in seven capital funds risk and a hybrid private venture capital funding (public/private risk sharing).</p>
<p>The Operational Program for the Economy (Programa Operacional da Economia, POE), which also channeling EU structural funds, had a priority support venture capital, seed capital or development capital and aimed at projects with high added value and foster public-private partnerships. Under the Programa Operacional da Economia (2000-2006), there have been several encouraging initiatives towards venture capital, through investment vehicles managed by both company created under the PEDIP1:</p>
<ul>
<li>PME Investimentos - (originally Norpedip, later Inovcapital and now Portugal Ventures). Originally, with 79 million euros in assets and with management the following funds:</li>
<li>FRIE / PME Investimentos Capital - General venture capital investment fund to finance companies with high growth potential in all sectors.</li>
<li>Retex - This fund is limited to smaller companies in textile producing regions that need corporate revitalization or who seek to expand internationally.</li>
<li>Global - This fund is intended for investments in start-up companies, business incubators and early stage projects with business potential.</li>
<li><p>Interregional - Fund financing start-up companies and small and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Portugal or operating in the region of Galicia in Spain.</p></li>
<li>PME Investimentos - (originally Sulpedip). Originally with 76 million euros in assets and with management the following funds:</li>
<li>FRIE / PME Investimentos - General capital investment fund to finance companies with high growth potential in all sectors.</li>
<li>Retex - This fund is limited to smaller companies in textile producing regions that need corporate revitalization or who seek to expand internationally.</li>
<li>Tiec - This fund is intended for investments in the fields of information and communication technologies (ICT), electronics and culture.</li>
<li><p>Global - This fund focuses on the financing of start-up, acquisitions and refinancing and revitalization of small companies with high growth potential.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The âFundo de SindicaÃ§Ã£o de Capital de Risco (FSCR)â has attempted to strengthen the role of government equity financing programs in stimulating private enterprise activity based on co-financing and risk-sharing. In particular, with the venture capital program, aimed at technology companies Novas Empresas de Suporte TecnolÃ³gico (NEST), which was designed to encourage early stage investment in R&amp;D projects that offer new products or services.</p>
<p>At the same time, the first venture capital funds, particularly private equity, were created as an extension of the national banking investment banking operations. In the venture capital segment, this is only developed later. In the private sector, EspÃ­rito Santo Ventures (created in 2006 owned by BES Group, had a vocation for venture capital, distinguishing itself from ES Capital or BESI internally, the latter being more oriented to private equity and M&amp;A) and Change Partners (established in 2003, based in Porto). There is also a reference to Pathena SGPS, which has previously had two cases (of the few), with successful outlets: Enabler (sold to Wipro in 2006) and Mobicomp (sold to Microsoft in 2008).</p>
<p>From 2008 (with a peak in 2011) an increase in the number of funds and VC management firms is visible, in parallel with the creation of risk-sharing systems, either co-financed by the State and / or the European Union, within the Strategic program, namely the âQuadro de ReferÃªncia EstratÃ©gico Nacionalâ (QREN) for the period 2007-2013.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Trusts</h3>
<p>Even today, particularly when considering issues such as fiduciary duties of managers, many of the concepts and principles have inspired in court decisions of the English courts to decide on management of trusts, as the important case Keech v Sandford (1724) which is recognized duties trust managers, including the duty of loyalty, where managers must prevent conflicts of interest in management.</p>
<p>The figure of the Trust, typical of common law regimes and absent from the national regime,<a href="#fn30" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> in which the Investment Funds figure is inspired, has a form of constitution:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Trust constitutes a separate fund and is not part of the assets owned by the Trustee;</li>
<li>The title of the assets in âTrustâ is in the name of the âTrusteeâ or on behalf of another person on behalf of the âTrusteeâ;</li>
<li>The Trustee has the power and duty to employ or dispose of property in accordance with the special duties imposed by law and is therefore accountable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, as essential elements, similar to the case of the Contract in favor of third person, this figure has: the manifestation of will of the Settlor; The identification and acceptance of the Trustee, the transfer of the assets to the ownership of the Trustee, the identification of the beneficiaries and intentions of distribution, temporality and revocability).</p>
<p>In addition, management rules, succession provisions, remunerations, discretion and limitations, âProtectorâ are provided for ancillary purposes.</p>
