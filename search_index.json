["Scope.html", "Chapter2 Scope, Limits and Methodology 2.1 Scope and Limits 2.2 Methodology", " Chapter2 Scope, Limits and Methodology Before any proposal, on Venture Capital investment, it was important to know how these investments (and disinvestments) were made today, in an integrated approach, looking with a systemic and dynamic logic, over time. In fact, much has been written, for a particular detail of this type of transactions, rarely, in fact, one looks at how all these mechanisms relate to each other, and finally how they are used. The main question to be answer is how venture capital deals are done in Portugal. Instead in relying on case basis, data was retrieved, collected, treated to present a reasonable sample. Also it was contextualised, going from a macro perspective to a micro perspective. Providing absolute numbers (so as percentage of small samples) without context, may lead to misleading interpretations. One can not tell the magnitude of a certain value within a certain context. This also applies when headlines are written “startup X raised 3 million”. Is a startup (company) X different from the other ones? 3 millions is it too much? In physical sciences theories are not formulated on a single observation, they must obey the basic principles of the “scientific method”. Still, in social sciences, individuals cannot be put under controlled experiments and either they always perform in the same manner. Between the intended outcome and what is observed there is a gap. Thus, this is not equivalent to any disregard of methodology. Similarly, when designing cities, houses or infrastructure one don´t use the weather data from places with considerable different weather and population patterns (i.e. north pole data to build a city in southeast Asia). Still, in this case we keep assuming that the empirical evidence of different systems will fit our own system. Statistics are used, but only a few provided the underlying data and (clear) methodology. Most studies used samples with less than 30 observations, where to any basic linear regression at least 50 (or 100, if using Box’s paper1) would be the minimum. There’s no explanation on how missing values or outliers were treated. Also averages are used with distributions that are not normal. It was also included the legal changes during the period, where usually most rely on some preconceived idea of the reality rather than any empirical study. Lastly, how results are presented. How easy is to verify (reproducible research); Can information be presented in such a manner that is easily understood? Lastly, how results are presented. How easy is to verify (Reproducible research); Can information be presented in such a manner that is easily understood? The intent is to provide an Descriptive Statistical Analysis (DEA), leaving potential inference exercises for the future. 2.1 Scope and Limits The present work is limited to venture capital investment operations, namely through venture capital funds, having as target companies, national companies. There will be no in-depth analysis of the remaining venture capital and private equity operations, i.e., private equity, which includes, among other operations, restructuring, refinancing and financing operations for companies already consolidated, as in the case of expansion operations. The financing through credit institutions, in particular by medium-long term loans, are excluded from this analysis due to the majority of these new companies do not have the minimum requirements for a favourable credit review (particularly the absence any assets or collateral to provide the credit institution2). 2.2 Methodology There are two main, and dependent issues that will be examined. Firstly, analysing the structural indicators of the portuguese ecosystem, or the Macro perspective and then answering the question how this investment has been done and put into context or gathering enough data for empirical analysis. Starting from a macro perspective to the single elements of the micro perspective of VC investments. Some sources were also compared, namely CMVM data was used and compared against the EVCA data. Both are signals of the same event: investment in Venture Capital, still the size of the samples are quite different. Depending on the source used, different interpretation can be drawn. Due to the lack or granularity of the last a sample was collected and structured 2 exercises were done: Descriptive Statistical Analysis (DEA); Network Analysis; It were analysed: Agents (Investors and Promoters); Deals (investment); Ecosystem (how the last 2 related to each other over time); Usually, most problems are analysed independently. Still, their interconnectivity demands that the an individual analysis of each elements and also how the whole functions. It was also included a historical perspective, with several layers per jurisdictional system, to contextualise this type of operations. Most emerge as a results of a certain goal and opportunity and, as a reaction towards some particular type of event (namely market bubbles). Risk and social aversion is understood differently across countries, so as fiscal incentives change considerably. Fiscal policies can also be viewed as an effort from Governments to promote certain type of behaviours (as increase on consumption or investment). It is therefore important to characterise the ecosystem as well as the actors and how they interact with one another. Taking into account the available data,3 in particular: Absence of data prior to 2006 in the Portal of Publications of the Ministry of Justice; The lack of previous venture capital report 2006 (in which the first is 2007, the CMVM); Considering the period of analysis (2007-2015), it is important to take into account, in a first approach, the Macroeconomic conditions of this period. Besides the absence of structured data4 (or the challenges of processing and analysis of natural language) and the little integration of the Law other areas. Often, they are visible only in the economic analysis of law. Other times, through reactive phenomena (and often augmented by the media, the so-called “Echo Chambers”) and, in the regulation after financial crises, such as an increase in the dissemination of technology-driven companies success stories and deregulation oriented to the last (In which the laws are abstract in its application and apply to all who fall into a particular category or fulfill predefined abstract requirements). Also, the case by case analysis of the problems is the so-called “cognitive bias” and “anchoring”, i.e., there is a tendency to value facts that one had contact, which may or may not be representative of a particular reality, as the frame the analysis at one of these extreme points5. Finally, timeline, or how agents relate to each other and respond to different types of incentives over time6. In the Portuguese case, it is hard to get data before 2006 due, on the one hand to the low expression of the object of study, as on the other, the difficulties and obstacles of the collection of data in digital format7.

["portuguese-ecosystem.html", "Chapter3 Portuguese Ecosystem 3.1 Market Conditions (Macro) 3.2 Social (risk aversion and bankruptcy)", " Chapter3 Portuguese Ecosystem Many studies carried on this type of investment in Portugal, usually choose to analyse a given particular case or take the data of all investment in venture capital, i.e., “private equity” and “venture capital”. As will be shown below, private equity investment is significantly predominant, both concerning the amount and number of transactions carried out. Considering that it wouldn’t be idoneous to assume the behavior of all venture capital and private equity investment, for the subcategory of venture capital, and secondly to look at an extended period of time (in reverse of a single year); several data was extracted (seeking use reliable sources) to build a report on the ecosystem of this type of investment. As already announced earlier, several assumptions are substantially different from the Portuguese system. To assert that one variable influences another, it requires an exercise of seeking data to infer any conclusion or even the impossibility of inferring. Thus, at an early stage it will be to examine various data intended to characterise the ecosystem in general (using the business indicators from INE), then will be looked for the subset of the entire venture capital and Private Equity. Finally to the particular case of venture capital built through different sources. Starting from a general plan to intermediate and, at last, micro. The aim is to introduce the different dimensions of the object and the actors under study, over time, in order to, on the one hand, contextualise, and on the other, present sources where the data collection focused on the subject and actors under review (Portuguese) and use of the national ecosystem data in order to better understand the problems and limitations. In fact, more than the solution to a given question, the question or hypothesis that is formulated, the data they use and the method turn out to be more important. The solution, in the end, corresponds only to the result of the equation and chosen variables. 3.1 Market Conditions (Macro) The period of analysis was noted by a number of events that caused or resulted in a fall in the (real) percentage growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product (shown in Chart 1).8 Chart 1 - Real GDP growth rate (#fig:r gdp-fig)GDP Between 2007 and 2015, the following events stand out: Internal: Law 62-A/2008, of November 11 - Nationalises all the shares representing the share capital of Banco Português de Negócios, SA, and approves the legal regime of public appropriation through nationalisation. On April 6, 2011, the Portuguese Government sent a request for financing to the European Commission, following the deterioration of the public debt financing capacity (almost 6% to 1 year, in which, in the secondary market, the five-year debt negotiated above the 10%, while the interest demanded by investors for 10-year Treasury bonds was close to 9%). Another important fact to note is that during the period from May 2011 to May 2014, Portugal was under a bailout program signed with the IMF, EU and ECB, “Memorandum of Understanding on Economic Policy Conditionalities”, which had for one side, deficit restrictions and, on the other hand, aimed to restructuring sectors in order to increase competitiveness. Resolution Fund was created by Decree-Law no. 31-A/2012, of February 10, which introduced a resolution regime in the General Regime of Credit Institutions and Financial Companies, approved by Decree-Law No. 298/92, of December 31. On August 3, 2014, the Board of Directors of Banco de Portugal decided to apply a resolution to Banco Espírito Santo, S.A. The generality of the activity and assets of Banco Espírito Santo, S.A. was transferred, immediately and definitively, to Novo Banco, duly capitalised and expurgated of problematic assets. Deposits would be fully preserved, as well as all non-subordinated bonds. On 20 December 2015 - Communication from the Bank of Portugal on the sale of Banif - Banco Internacional do Funchal, SA, “The operation involves an estimated public support of € 2 255 million to cover future contingencies, € 489 million of which Resolution Fund and € 1,766 million directly by the State, as a result of the options agreed between the Portuguese authorities, the European bodies and Banco Santander Totta, to delimit the perimeter of assets and liabilities to be divested.” External On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers, one of the largest US banks, announced the bankruptcy, with a debt of $700 billion. The Dow jumped 504.48 points, the highest since September 17, 2001. Sovereign debt crisis (2009-2012): From the end of 2009 and early 2010, some eurozone countries began to have difficulties in financing their debts. The uncertainty of the markets began by making the normal public debt issuance operations costly and ultimately rendering them unsustainable. Legislative changes with impact on the object of study: The amendment and revision of the Commercial Companies Code in 2006 (through Decree-Law no. 76-A/2006, of 29 March), which updates and makes flexible the governance models of corporations, adopts simplification measures and Elimination of acts and notarial and registration procedures and approves the new legal framework for the dissolution and liquidation of commercial entities. Amendment of Decree-Law no. 33/2011 of March 7, amends the Commercial Companies Code, providing that the share capital of the limited companies to be incorporated can be freely set by the shareholders and that they proceed to the delivery of their entries in the company’s accounts until the end of the first financial year. Authorization in the Portuguese legal system of the admissibility of so-called shares without par value, within the scope of corporations, through the publication of Decree-Law no. 49/2010, of May 19. Changes to the non-voting preferred stock regime and bonds in the Commercial Companies Code through Decree-Law no. 26/2015, February 6. Amendment of the insolvency regime, through Law no. 16/2012, of April 20, amending the Insolvency and Restructuring Code, approved by Decree-Law no. 53/2004, of March 18, simplifying formalities and procedures and instituting the Processo Especial de Revitalização (PER). Introduction of SIREVE (Sistema de Recuperação de Empresas por Via Extrajudicial), regulated by Decree-Law no. 178/2012, of August 3, republished by Decree-Law no. 26/2015, of February 6, which has As an object “a procedure which seeks to promote the extrajudicial restructuring of undertakings by concluding an agreement between the company and all or some of its creditors, to enable it to be restructured and to ensure its sustainability. Most of the funds were constituted from 2008, namely after the publication of Decree-Law no. 375/2007, of November 8, regulating the exercise of the activity of investment in venture capital; FINOVA - Fundo de Apoio ao Fundamento ao Inovação - was established by Decree-Law no. 175/2008, of August 26, as a privileged instrument for the achievement of the objectives established in SAFPRI (Sistema de Apoio ao Financiamento e Partilha de Risco da Inovação). This program, created under the National Strategic Reference Framework (QREN), whose financing entities are the Operational Competitiveness Factors Program (COMPETE) and the Regional Operational Programs of Lisbon and Algarve, aimed to promote the dissemination of financing instruments that provide better financing conditions for Portuguese SMEs. Amendment of the legal regime of venture capital, namely through the amendment to the General Regime of Collective Investment Schemes, approved by Law no. 16/2015, of February 24 and the Legal Regime of Venture Capital (RJCR) approved by Law 18/2015, of March 4. Law no. 15/2017 of May 3, prohibits the issuance of bearer securities and amends the Securities Code, approved by Decree-Law no. 486/99, of November 13, and the Commercial Companies Code, approved by Decree-Law no. 262/86, of September 2. Amendment of the Commercial Company Code and Insolvency Codes, namely the regarding the conversion of shareholder´s loan into equity shares so as the review of a special restructuring regimes, approved by Decree-Law no. 79/2017, of June 30. 3.1.1 The Portuguese business fabric A “startup” is first and foremost a company (in a broad sense), which its aim is the pursuit of profit, usually in the form of a commercial company. Considering the data collected and processed by the INE “Main Economic and Patrimonial Indicators of Companies in Portugal”, illustrated are several indicators for the reporting period (from 2004 to 2014, i.e., until the last series available). Before understanding what distinguishes this type of companies from the other, it is considered important to know on the one hand the demographics, as the balance sheets indicators, on the whole. Although the acquisition and transfer of businesses can be made through the direct acquisition “trespasse”, the instant case is under investment through the so-called “indirect participation”, i.e., of the shares in a commercial company. 3.1.1.1 Demographic Indicators (DI) 3.1.1.1.1 Enterprises (sole traders + commercial companies) Chart 2 - DI Enterprises by legal type (sole traders + commercial companies) Enterprises (sole traders + commercial companies) In 2014 the total number of businesses was composed of 764 902 sole traders “Empresas individuais” and 362 415 commercial companies, making a total of 1 127 317, as shown in Chart 2, this division of approximately 1: 3, has remained more or less constant. Chart 3 - Total Enterprises per NACE Of the total number of companies, the majority do not have economic activity usually known as “high growth”, in particular the activities that comprise the sections: (i) C - Manufacturing (ie the production of goods); (ii) Information and communication activities (this section includes activities related to the production of software, web and others); and (iii) M - Scientific, technical and similar consultancy activities (in this section are also Development and Research (R&amp;D) activities, as well as engineering and other sciences). The information and communication activities are a small part of the total, and no significant change in the relative number of companies is visible. Considering the rate of renewal, the main indicators are the number of births and number of deaths. Chart 4 - Total Business Enterprises - Births and Deaths It was considered the absolute number where roughly 150 000 companies are created annually, and between 2008 and 2012, more companies were closed than those created in those years. Considering survival rate (i.e., from the time of incorporation up to two years after this event), as illustrated in Chart 5, it is important to consider: Chart 5 - Enterprise’s survival rate Not all companies survive, where roughly ⅓ is closed after one year; Only 50% of the incorporated companies survive, that is, they are in activity after 2 years. 3.1.1.1.2 Commercial Companies Considering only commercial companies (i.e. a total of 362 415 enterprises in 2014), there are approximately 30 000 companies incorporated per year (33 241 in 2014). Chart 6 - Total Companies - Births and Deaths As with businesses, but more pronounced manner the period 2008 to 2012 was marked by a significant destruction of companies. Chart 7 - Total Companies - Births and Deaths Similarly, there are a considerable part of commercial companies who do not survive, where the variations are more pronounced in recent years. Chart 8 - Company´s net birth Given the net births (total births - Total deaths) between 2009 and 2012 the balance was negative. Finally, the sections described above were disaggregated compared to the others. Chart 9 - Company´s net birth per NACE By analysing these 3 economic activities, it is apparent that stands the net incorporation of companies with Scientific and technical activities and, on the other hand, significant destruction (as compared to the other) companies with manufacturing activities, over the period (i.e. the value below 0 on the horizontal axis). Chart 10 - Company´s survival rate per NACE (base year 2010) Using the year 2010, as base year, it was calculated the survival rate (percentage) in which: These three classes perform better than the totality over all periods; Of these three, the one that has a worse survival rate are those related to Information Activities. Of the total number of companies created, at the end of 4 years, approximately 60% survives (overall), with those in the Industry sector having a higher survival rate of 70%. On the contrary, 40% does not survive and there is a high percentage that does not survive. It is important to keep this in mind when it is considered extinct (by liquidation, by the initiative of the shareholders, or due to insolvency). 3.1.2 Balance Sheet indicators The balance sheet indicators only focus on commercial companies in which, according to the methodological notes of such series, the ratios are calculated using the following formulas: \\[Financial\\,Autonomy = \\frac{Total\\,capital}{Total \\,assets}\\] \\[Indebtedness = \\frac{Total\\,liabilities}{Total \\,assets}\\] \\[Solvability = \\frac{Total\\,Equity}{Total \\,Liabilities}\\] \\[Debt\\,to\\,equity = \\frac{Total\\,Liabilities}{Total \\,Equity}\\] Chart 11 - Company’s financial ratios One of the important conclusions is that, considering the financial ratios described: In general terms, companies are financed mainly from non equity instruments: These have a reduced financial autonomy and part of it is financed through non-equity non-equity capital. There has not been a significant change since 2004, only changes in the solvency ratio are visible, with the remaining stable over time. Chart 12 - Net profit Considering that most companies are SMEs, disaggregating and comparing by size, SMEs have results (net) worse than the whole of the companies. A contrario, most of the population (SMEs) do not have results similar to the whole, i.e. there is a fraction (large companies), which significantly alter the overall results. Chart 13 - Debt to equity Overall, a decrease in the debt to equity ratio is visible, particularly from 2010. Whereas: \\(Assets = Liabilities + Equity\\), and; \\(Equity = Share\\, Capital + Reserves + Retained\\,Earnings\\), an increase in the debt (numerator) with the absence or decrease of retained positive results (affecting the denominator) may result deterioration of this ratio. On the basis of the concept that companies finance their activities through equity or debt, in the event of a deterioration in the economic activity, by not generating or producing sufficient resources to sustain economic activity and/or companies without accumulated surpluses, will only be able to resort to greater indebtedness to finance this deficit. Another restriction may be on the offer of funds, or the conditions (e.g. the interest rate, the guarantees required for credit approval) to which these funds are offered. Chart 14 - SME´s Financial Ratios Considering only SMEs, no significant change to the ratios above is visible. Chart 15 - SME´s Debt to equity per NACE However, disaggregating by Economic Activity (only considering SMEs) is visible, that the Information and communication activities has a higher debt to equity and, the Scientific and technical activities less than the totality of the companies. Chart 16 - SME´s Net profit per NACE Considering for the net results of the period, the Scientific and Technical activities ones performs worse than the others, in which the Information and Communication ones had better results. The manufacturing ones, have resulted in line with the globality of the companies. Chart 17 - SME´s Solvability per NACE Looking to solvency, those of manufacturing and more accentuated, the Scientific and Technical activities, present better solvency ratios than the others, in which the Information and Communication Activities have a weaker solvency ratio than the globality of the companies. 3.1.2.1 Structure of the Balance Sheet Chart 18 - Structure of the Balance Sheet In absolute terms, a deterioration of total assets is visible, but the percentage ratio between asset financing remained stable over the period. Whereas the assets includes everything that the company has and is likely to be assessed in cash - cash balances (in cash, bank deposits and marketable securities), customer’s credit, goods, equipment, facilities, etc., a reduction is visible accentuated since 2008. As a point of reference, the variable “General Assets”, which corresponds to the “Asset” in Chart 18 of the above companies, was added. Chart 19 - Structure of the Balance Sheet C - Manufacturing This same trend is not visible when considering only the companies in Manufacturing activities. Chart 20 - Structure of the Balance Sheet J - Information and Communication In the case of information and communication activities, these have a considerable peak between 2009 and 2013, returning in 2014 to pre-2009 levels. Chart 21 - Structure of the Balance Sheet M - Professional, scientific and technical activities In the case of Scientific and technical and activities, it is visible a sustained increase since 2004. It can thus be concluded that these companies in these three economic activities have a structure of the balance sheet, with different behavior of the whole of the companies. 3.1.2.2 High-Growth Companies and High-Growth young Companies “Gazelles” According to the INE methodological notes, are: High-growth enterprises - Companies (with 10 or more paid employees) with an average annual growth of more than 10% over a three-year period, growth being measured in terms of the number of paid employees High growth young enterprises - Companies (with 10 or more paid people) up to 5 years of age with an average annual growth of more than 10% over over a three-year period, growth being measured in terms of the number of paid employees (Gazelles). Considering the object of study and after analysing the composition, in general terms and in the overall Portuguese business fabric, it is important to question: Relative percentage of companies that fall into one of the two classifications, that is, comparatively there are many or few companies with these traits? It was added companies with 10 or more paid people to serve as a midpoint. Chart 22 - Number of Companies by size and growth Portugal has a large number of micro-enterprises, according to the Chart below, (2014) 320 952 of the total of 362 415 (that is that of the total, less than 10% employs more than 10 people). Chart 23 - Number of Companies per size Using the year 2014 as an example, in relative terms of 362 415 companies, only 39 648 have more than 10 persons employed. Chart 24 - Number of Companies per growth rate (breakdown) Whereas in both cases of high-growth companies, it has a requirement to have more than 10 persons employed, of the 39 648 existing only 3415 meet the cumulatively with the requirement “with an average annual growth exceeding 10% over a period of 3 years”. If added the requirement “up to 5 years of age”, only 343 meet the requirements to be considered “high growth young companies”. In order to illustrate the proportion of those who fulfill these requirements, the number of companies was placed in the bar Chart below, in absolute terms. Chart 25 - Number of Companies per growth rate (Comparison, 2014) In percentage wise, less than 1% of the companies is a “high growth company” and less than 0.1% meet the requirements of “Young High growth company.” When analysing what are “startups”, this classification proves to be important, to demonstrate that in relative terms we are analysing a very small part of the population. 3.1.2.2.1 High-growth Companies Chart 26 - High-growth Companies per NACE Considering high-growth enterprises and high-growth young enterprises, it has been broken down by economic activity and, unlike the general scenario, where information and communication activities are a small part, as mentioned above, in this group the manufacturing activities , Scientific, technical and similar consultancy activities and information and communication activities makes up more than half of that has these attributes, in which, considering the year 2014, manufacturing has over almost 1/3 of so-called high-growth companies (1075 a total of 3415). The other two classes have 184 (Professional, scientific and technical activities) and 152 (information and communication activities). Chart 27 - “Gazelles” (young High-growth companies) per NACE The same can be observed in young high growth companies, out of a total of 343 (2014), 103 are under Manufacturing economic activities, 22 Scientific and Technical activities and only 13 Information and Communication activities. As will be analysed later, this data contrast with the number of companies (by economic activity) that had venture capital financing. That is, it is considered that the companies related to digital services, programming (which fall into the section J - Information and communication services) would be those that would have better performance, but in comparison, are the manufacturing ones, where there are more occurrences. On the other hand, since 2008 (or since there is data), the maximum number of companies in this section has always been less than 20, reaching its peak in 2010. On the other hand 2011, as will be seen below, due to availability of funds through public risk sharing instruments, was the year in which more venture capital funds were set up, as the type of companies that invested the most. 3.1.3 Agent Expectations The decision to start, or not an economic activity, depends on the will of the agents, that is, the perception that the agent has of the opportunity and the possibility (or probability) of being successful. The following Qualitative Business Indicators were considered from January 2004 to December 2015: 3.1.3.1 Economic climate indicator (% - mm3m) Chart 28 - Climate indicator (% - 3mma); Monthly - Statistics Portugal, Short-term statistics on business Are visible two breaks, one in 2008 and another in 2011 that extends until 2014, coinciding with the fall of the Lehman Brothers, cited above, and with the subprime crisis and IMF intervention. At the end of 2015 would already be in the next levels before these two periods. Evaluation of global demand (Balance) for manufacturing industry and global order books over the last 3 months (Balance) for services9 Chart 29 - Evaluation of global demand (Balance) for manufacturing industry and global order books over the last 3 months (Balance) for services Although with similar behavior to the economic climate indicator, the information and communication activities, which until 2011 had better results (red line), one notes the sharp drop from 2011, in which it has results are similar to the whole, as it is visible in with consultancy activities. However, the recovery from 2013 onwards is not accompanied by Information Activities which, even at the end of 2015, shows the worst evaluation, i.e. a complete reversal of what was visible between 2004 and 2011. For Manufacturing Industry (blue line) the assessment was more negative in 2008 than in 2011 (compared with the other two indicators) and during 2011 the drop is less pronounced, in which also has improved . 3.1.4 Capital Markets The Portuguese capital markets10, compared to the English or American, has underperformed the other two. As already announced during the reporting period, Portugal was under the Financial Assistance Program. Chart 31 - PSI20, FTSE and S&amp;P50011 However, even considering the period 2007 (before the 2008 crisis) until December 31, 2015, it is visible poor development and performance of this market. Chart 31 - PSI20 % Change12 Since mid-2014 the PSI-20 has fewer than 20 companies, which highlights the exits of Banco Espírito Santo (2014), Espírito Santo Financial Group (2014), Banif, (2015, which was excluded from the trading at the end last year after another bank resolution) as well as Cimpor, Brisa, Impresa and Teixeira Duarte. On the other hand, in 2016 entered Sonae Capital, Corticeira Amorim and Montepio, but they still have less than 20 companies (18) of listed companies. In percentage terms, only signed two peaks in 2000 and 2008, both with a marked fall in line with what happened with other exchanges, after the bubble dot com (2000) and the fall of Lehman and subsequent sovereign debt crisis (2012) . 3.1.5 Taxes One of the aspects of investment funds, particularly venture capital, is to have more favorable fiscal rules, usually as a result of the use of tax changes, as a way of encouraging certain investments. 3.1.5.1 Stamp Duty As direct taxes on this type of transactions it is important to mention taxes on financing operations, namely the incidence of Stamp Duty. As a general rule, all credit operations are subject to taxation (where the incidence rate varies according to the maturity of the loan).Stamp Duty As direct taxes on this type of transactions it is important to mention taxes on financing operations, namely the incidence of Stamp Duty. As a general rule, all credit operations are subject to taxation (where the incidence rate varies according to the maturity of the loan). However, Article 7 of the CIS provides for the following exemptions: Financial operations, including interest, for a period of time not exceeding one year, provided that such operations are exclusively designed to cover a financial slack, which are carried out by venture capital companies in behalf of a company in which they hold a participation, as well as those operations carried out by SGPS´s (holding companies) in behalf of their own controlled companies or of companies in which they hold a participation under certain conditions, or if carried out in behalf of the holding company (SGPS) having a controlling or group relation with it; (subheading g) of para. 1 of the art. 7.º of CIS) The above-mentioned financial operations, including interest, if carried out by the owners of capital stock to an entity in which they directly hold a participation of at least 10 per cent, and provided that such participation is held for an uninterrupted year or since the incorporation of the controlled entity, in which case such participation must be held for that period of time; (subheading h) of para. 1 of the art. 7.º of CIS) Loans of a contributing nature, including interest thereon, made by the members of a company, provided that an initial term of at least one year has been established and such loans are not to be reimbursed before such period of time has elapsed; (subheading i) of para. 1 of art. 7.º of CIS): Capital losses and other losses relating to equity instruments are not yet deductible, to the part of the amount corresponding to the profits or reserves distributed or to the capital gains realized on the transfer of shares of the same entity that have benefited on the own taxation period or, in the four previous periods, of the participation exemption or international economic double taxation (para. 2 of article 7.ºof CIS) Constitution and increase of the share capital of holding companies (SGPS) and venture capital companies (SCR); 3.1.5.2 Capital Gains Gains and losses arising from onerous transfers, events or permanent transfers to activities other than those effectively exercised by the entities in question, which relate to tangible fixed assets, intangible assets, as well as assets are considered as gains or losses. Non-current assets held for sale, as well as financial instruments, except for those recognized at fair value, except when the financial instruments are recognized at fair value for results and changes in fair value have contributed to the formation of taxable income. In the case of onerous transfers carried out in the course of merger operations, when no shares are allocated to the partner of the merged company, a capital gain or loss of shares is deemed to be the positive or negative difference, respectively, between the value of market share capital of the merged company on the date of the transaction and the acquisition value of the equity shares held by shareholders of the merged company. In addition, the tax gains / losses usually differ from +/- Gains = accounting and are quantified as follows: +/- taxable income = Realization Amount - (Acquisition value - Accumulated depreciation - impairment losses) X depreciation coefficient of the single currency 3.1.5.3 General rules for the taxation of investors in Collective Investment Schemes With regard to the taxation applicable to income earned by holders of units / shares of investment collective schemes, it is applied the rules of taxation on the “exit” (when they are liquidated/sold). In the case of income earned by investors resident in the country, they are subject to tax on personal income tax (usually at the rate of 28%) and IRC (contributing to the formation of the taxable income of the investor). In addition, income from the units of the VF Fund, paid or made available to the respective holders, whether by distribution or through a redemption operation, shall be subject to a withholding tax of IRS or IRC at the rate of 10% except where the holders of income is exempt entities on income or capital of non-resident entities without a permanent establishment in Portuguese territory, to which the income is attributable. This regime is however removed - the IRS and IRC tax regime foreseen for resident investors is applied - whenever the holders are resident on offshore or, as a general rule, are held in more than 25% by residents of Portugal . 3.1.5.4 Specific case of Venture Capital These are exempt from IRC when set up and operate under national law. In the case of venture capital funds13 are exempt (Article 23.º of the EBF) as well as investment management firms (32.-A of the EBF).14 Venture Capital Fund – FCR (Article 23.º) - Exempt from IRC are incomes obtained by a FCR established and operated according to the domestic laws. Income from participating units paid or made available to the respective owners either by distribution or redemption shall be taxed by way of withholding at source under IRS and IRC at a 10 per cent rate, provided that the holders of such income are entities exempted from capital income or non-resident entities with no permanent establishment in the Portuguese territory to which the income is attributable; Shareholding management companies (SGPS), Venture Capital Companies (SCR) and Venture Capital Investors (ICR) (Article 32) - Exemption of dividends received from controlled companies by way of the application of the regime for elimination of economic double taxation as provided for under the IRC Code, regardless of any requirement in respect of the percentage or the participating value. Capital gains and capital losses realised by a SGPS, SCR or a ICR from the corporate rights held by them (provided that they are held for at least one year) and from financial charges borne on the acquisition thereof shall not be considered as forming part of the taxable profit of these companies. The SCR and ICR may deduct from the amount ascertained for IRC purposes and up to the amount thereof, an amount corresponding to the limit of the total amount of the IRC taxable amounts of the five taxable periods preceding that to which the benefit refers, provided that such amount is used as investment in companies with a high potential of increase and improvement. The deduction is carried out in respect of the IRC assessment for the accounting period in which the investments were made or, in case of insufficiency of assessed income, up to the end of the five subsequent accounting periods; This regime establishes the possibility for VC Firms to deduct the tax until their competition, limited to the sum of IRC from the previous five years, provided that this amount is invested in companies with potential for growth and appreciation. This deduction must be made in the year in which the investments are realized or, when it can not be fully, in the liquidation of the following five years. However, potential losses, as they do not fall within the tax deductible provisions, are also not relevant to the formation of the referred profit. Thus, the taxation of these gains (or deduction of losses) occurs only in the year in which the gain (capital loss) be realized by the sale of shareholding and only if there are no requirements that allow the exemption (non-deduction) Of this income (Participation Exemption Regime). Compared to the US and the UK, besides the capital gains tax and the exemptions described (and corresponding non deduction in the case of losses), there is also the corporate tax rate of companies subject to investment. Although financing costs are considered at a cost to company, other factors seem to be more relevant, such as the investment policy of the funds (i.e. the eligibility of the use of debt instruments), the risk of bankruptcy and the possibility of repayment (Or liquidity preference). Moreover the forms of compensation (or often used as promotional incentives the management of these funds) used in other systems, such as cases of “ratchet” (a breakdown of return on capital invested in a company between the fund and the management) or “Carried interest” (the management’s share of the fund, usually 20% of the net profit realized by the fund during its useful life), has no specific or special treatment in IRS or IRC. 3.1.6 Corporate governance and investor protection One of the important factors for investment, particularly in companies with a high level of risk, is the corporate governance and investor protection. As indicated in the previous paragraph, will be analysed, including issues relating to investor partner, as the rights of shareholders and the limits of certain provisions, such as the penalty clauses. Furthermore, one of the key components in any corporate governance system is transparency (or disclosure of information). Without this it is not possible to monitor managers and, consequently, to induce changes in management (essential shareholders’ right). In addition to internal monitoring by shareholders, external monitoring, by creditors and the system in general, provides a better and appropriate tool for issues such as risk analysis (e.g., lenders), reduction of opportunistic behaviour of management compensation decisions), equal treatment of potential investors (particularly in the market). Unlike the United Kingdom, where there is a further development of corporate governance principles in Portugal, these practices are only visible in more consolidated and larger companies. For example, the provision of paragraph 2 of Article 70 of the Companies Code, concerning the duty of accountability, as it provides that “the company shall make available to interested parties free of charge on its Internet site, if any, and in its headquarters a full copy”namely the Management Report the Report on the structure and practices of corporate governance, and the legal Certification of the accounts. Removing the case of listed companies and the Government, the cases that have “Internet site” and these documents will be available rare15. Contrast, with the United Kingdom, that already in 1991 creates a commission that gives shape to the Cadbury Report, which contained recommendations for a better Corporate Governance. This is just one of the contrasting examples in which there is self-regulation16 (through guilds, professional orders), to protect “trust” in the market, without dependence or needs to have a legislative act to create and define these duties of conduct. 3.2 Social (risk aversion and bankruptcy) One of the features that most distinguishes the Anglo Saxon system, from the Portuguese (or opposition from continental Europe), seems to be the way it is perceived and understood the risk, as well as bankruptcy. Max Weber17, in “The Protestant Ethic and the” Spirit “of Capitalism” (in the German original Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus) investigates the relationship between a certain form of economic conduct and its religious roots. One of the conclusions is the way “work” is seen or those who succeed because of work. As opposed to in countries with Catholic roots, there is an idea of equality and the virtue of “poverty”. Leaving aside the issue of pre-pack procedures (insolvency), these systems seem to allow for more flexibility in opening and closing companies, thus less inefficient businesses in the system, which compensate with more “accountability”18 and surveillance. On the other hand, it is faster to solve these inefficiencies, as opposed to a more guaranteed system, like the continental ones. 3.2.1 Historical perspective In the field of law, it is common to define 3 essential changes for the development of companies: Creation of public companies (or joint stock companies); Freedom of establishment / incorporation; The limitation of liability; In the case of Stock Public Companies, it is also important to consider: Regulation concerning information duties (in particular if sold to the general public, appearing to protect investors, usually in response to financial crises); Regulation of competition (notably in the context of mergers and acquisitions) where, unlike Europe, the freedom of private enterprise is established in contrast to the companies that were granted monopolies in Europe.19 In the mechanisms and investment vehicles: Regulation of the trust (namely in the United Kingdom); Regulation of the investment vehicles (type of assets and the fiduciary duties that are attached); Can thus consider three-time series, the first phase, intrinsically linked to the commercial monopoly, a second phase, linked essentially to the Industrial Revolution and a third, beginning after World War II. Unlike other countries (with the same development of the “Enterprise”), Portugal did not find a great production of systematic norms (except for sparse rules), and there is no autonomisation of commercial law from private law. As Coutinho de Abreu points out,20 “commercial law is considered globally special (not exceptional - although it contains exceptional rules). It is a legal branch with rules different from those of ordinary law, applicable only to certain subjects, objects and relations - but without excluding the applicability of civil law as common and subsidiary law.” On the other hand the commercial law is rooted, in international trade treaties as well as the uses and customs features rules; the principle of credit enhancement (insolvency risk), protection of legitimate expectations (bookkeeping duties and publicity); (Eg freedom of form and rapid transfer of securities) and the presumption of charges (for example, the mandate), the application of the solidarity regime in commercial obligations (Article 100.º of the Commercial Code) , Commercial interest (legal or conventional, remuneration, interest over principal) and arrears (reparation or compensation) are due, in the cases provided for in the CSC. Unlike the CC not previse interest (reduced in writing) is applied complementarily to paragraph 1 legal rate of 2 C Commercial art. 3.2.2 Timeline of major changes throughout history A timeline was drawn up, with major legislative changes and relevant facts (notably when many of the norms are born in response to a particular situation, such as market bubbles) not only from Portugal, but from England and the Netherlands (where The first manifestations of regulation of the company with its capital divided by shares are visible), the US (where many of the tools are inspired) and the EU (from which emanate many of the rules now into force). Much of the literature in law, opt to make comparison and contextualisation with closest jurisdictions (notably the German, Italian or Lex Mercatoria21 for more distant periods). In Corporate Finance, many of the studies are based on observations in markets such as American or English. On the other hand, London and New York being of the main financial centres, it is usual to send,22 in particular, financing contracts, to one of these jurisdictions.

Decree-Law 17/86 of 5 February - establishes provisions on the formation of venture capital companies. In its preamble it may read: “Venture capital companies constitute a new legal entity in Portugal and, even in Europe, represent a recent instrument for promoting investment and introducing technological innovation. The essence of venture capital companies is the deliberate search And systematic investment opportunities capable of generating added value and providing income to investors, justifying the application of capital through the purchase of shares and quotas of companies with potential for expansion and viability. On the other hand, the creation of venture capital companies is part of a policy of encouraging the use of corporate capitalization instruments - financing through capital inflows - which will also make an important contribution to boosting the market Of capital. The institutional solution adopted is flexible enough to encourage the emergence of venture capital companies from private enterprise, which can be used to involve public entities interested in promoting investment, job creation and technological modernization. In order to safeguard the position of entrepreneurs, it is intended to guarantee to some extent the temporary and minority nature of the participation of venture capital companies, and their use as control companies is forbidden, but without prejudice to their viability, The phase of incipient development of our capital market. In the meantime, the various tax incentive systems already in place with a view to boosting the capital market will be considered in order to establish a tax system applicable to VC companies compatible with the objectives to be attained. “; Decree-Law 187/91 of 17 May creates the investment funds for venture capital and regulates the specific aspects of their formation and operation - It creates venture capital funds and regulates the specific aspects of their formation and operation, including restructuring and internationalization funds (FRIE). In its preamble one can read: “It is convenient to develop the activities of risk capital, given the role they can play in the acceleration of productive investment and in the restructuring of the national business fabric, with the present diploma a new type is created of investment funds, the”venture capital funds“, and the specific aspects of their constitution and functioning are regulated.

The Dutch East India Company or the Company Dutch East India formally United East India Company (Dutch, “Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie” with the VOC acronym) was a real company formed by the Dutch, in 1602 - two years later of the formation of the English East India Company - with the aim of trying to exclude competition from other European companies from that important trade route. The headquarters were in Amsterdam, where the Bank of Amsterdam was created in 1609 to support colonial trade. It is in this financial dynamic created by the Dutch company that the current concept of shares (aktien) will arise through the division of its equity into equal and transferable shares. However, due to the good results, it will become increasingly a nationalized agency with military authority and military power to administer or enforce its rights and claims in the seas. Taxes on goods and rent were a significant source of revenue for the Dutch state. After the IV Anglo-Dutch War (1780-1784), the VOC began to have financial problems and was liquidated in 1799. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the Dutch East Indies were officially transferred to the Dutch crown. East India Company, which was dissolved in 1874 (after frequent government interventions and with constant financial problems), through the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act approved a year earlier. In the case of England it was possible to set up companies, but they depended on administrative authorization (Act of Parliament or Royal Charter), where a certain monopoly was guaranteed in a certain territory, as in the case of the East India Company and with the advent of the stock market and Stock market brought new complexities of business organizations. Already Adam Smith, analising the Public Limited Companies of his time, wrote: “This total exemption from risk, beyond a limited sum, encourages many people to become adventurers in joint stock companies, who would, upon no account, hazard their fortunes in any private copartnery.”23 For example, in 1711, with the creation of the South Sea Company, a joint stock company. It has assumed the liabilities of England, which had resulted from the War of Spanish Succession. In return, a monopoly was given to trade in colonies, in South America of Spain. There was great speculation about the value of the company and, this speculation ultimately resulted in an economic bubble, the South Sea Bubble of 1720, which caused the financial ruin for many investors. In order to control this speculation, the British Parliament approved the “Bubble Act” of 1720, prohibiting all joint stock companies unauthorized by a royal charter. Throughout this process of corporate evolution, the nature of management has shifted from “a communion of personal knowledge to that of an impersonal collective.” and “A fellowship of personal acquaintances to that of an impersonal collective.” The ban on setting up businesses without a Royal Charter of Bubble Act 1720 remained until 1824. With the industrial revolution restrictions were gradually withdrawn, namely from incorporation, in order to facilitate the pursuit of commercial activity. Through the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, it was possible through a mere registration process (not so dependent on administrative or royal authorization) to establish a company, which had all the rights and obligations related to commercial activity and all shareholders and investors could articulate their corporate relationships. In 1855 the limitation of liability was introduced through the Limited Liability Act 1855, which brought the benefit of limitation of liability to investors in the event of bankruptcy of the company. These two measures were subsequently gathered in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856, and it is now in force the Companies Act 2006. 3.2.3.1 Portugal As far as continental law (or as opposed to common law) countries are concerned, it was only in 1807 that the French Commercial Code provided for corporations, where their constitution was also subject to government authorization. In Portugal, the Commercial Code 1833, provided similar authorization (requiring administrative recognition) for these companies. Only in 1867 (with the Law of 22 June 1867) which was regulated for the first time in Portugal, the public limited company, with individual freedom of establishment, subsequently amended and incorporated into the Commercial Code 1888 passing from 1986, to be regulated by the Commercial Companies Code (CSC). With the emergence of finance capital and freedom of establishment of corporations, as on the other hand there are conditions for allocating surpluses in others assets, combined with the limitation of liability, as the very creation of the Stock Exchange (in 1891 the porto and Lisbon 1901), ie creating liquidity for the trading of these assets, the conditions were created for larger scale business financing market, which were impossible if you only depended on equity of shareholders “businessman.” Thus originates what is still referred to as business or majority shareholders and investor shareholders. As in the British case, the dispersion of capital and the separation between the management of the company and the owners of capital, brought an increasing complexity of the management of companies, today this phenomenon is referred to as “agency problem”. 3.2.3.2 Present Many authors define the American Research and Development Corporation (ARD)24 as the first venture capital firm.25 Given the potential of this project, the US government created the Small Business Investments Companies Administration (SIBCA), which, when managing a set of tax benefits and subsidized credits, was created by Georges Doriot, Ralph Flanders and Karl Compton, enabled the development of the venture capital industry. The establishment of companies in what is now known as “Silicon Valley” and its constructions has as one of its precursor Fairchild Semiconductor. The history of Fairchild passes through the establishment of another institution, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories in Santa Clara Valley in 1955. In 1957, Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Eugene Kleiner, Jean Hoerni, Jay Last, Gordon Moore,26 Robert Noyce and Sheldon Roberts created the Fairchild Semiconductor and later developed the functional integrated circuit (in 1961), being considered one of the most significant inventions. Not only for the area, but also for the creation of technological companies (or what is now known as “startups”). They consider that one of the first successes of this new form of investment was in 1957 with the investment in the Digital Equipment Corporation, in which in 1966, the investors get return equivalent to several multiples of the capital invested through the Public Offer of Acquisition launched by this one. From this company, other derivatives are born, such as Intel (founded by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce) in 1968. In the 1970s, (until the 1987 crash) created what is now called private equity27, originally in the US. 3.2.3.2.1 Portugal until nowdays In Portugal, in addition to issues related to the regime that was in force until 1974, the first similar operations were carried out through “business development” funds, in particular through the so-called “Restructuring and Enterprise Internationalization Funds”28 (fundos de reestruturação e internacionalização empresarial, FRIE). The development of Venture Capital originated from public venture capital frameworks:29 created in 1986 as a measure of Programa Específico de Desenvolvimento de Indústria Português 1 (PEDIP 1), in which funds were distributed through the Instituto de Apoio às Pequenas e Médias Empresas (IAPMEI) to two venture capital companies, Norpedip (PME Capital) and Sulpedip (PME Investimentos), created in 1999 and both owned by the the State. The PEDIP 1 was followed by PEDIP 2 for the period from 1994 to 2000. During the PEDIP 2, in order to stimulate private investment activity, government programs put the Structural Funds of the European Union (EU) in seven capital funds risk and a hybrid private venture capital funding (public/private risk sharing). The Operational Program for the Economy (Programa Operacional da Economia, POE), which also channeling EU structural funds, had a priority support venture capital, seed capital or development capital and aimed at projects with high added value and foster public-private partnerships. Under the Programa Operacional da Economia (2000-2006), there have been several encouraging initiatives towards venture capital, through investment vehicles managed by both company created under the PEDIP1: PME Investimentos - (originally Norpedip, later Inovcapital and now Portugal Ventures). Originally, with 79 million euros in assets and with management the following funds: FRIE / PME Investimentos Capital - General venture capital investment fund to finance companies with high growth potential in all sectors. Retex - This fund is limited to smaller companies in textile producing regions that need corporate revitalization or who seek to expand internationally. Global - This fund is intended for investments in start-up companies, business incubators and early stage projects with business potential. Interregional - Fund financing start-up companies and small and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Portugal or operating in the region of Galicia in Spain. PME Investimentos - (originally Sulpedip). Originally with 76 million euros in assets and with management the following funds: FRIE / PME Investimentos - General capital investment fund to finance companies with high growth potential in all sectors. Retex - This fund is limited to smaller companies in textile producing regions that need corporate revitalization or who seek to expand internationally. Tiec - This fund is intended for investments in the fields of information and communication technologies (ICT), electronics and culture. Global - This fund focuses on the financing of start-up, acquisitions and refinancing and revitalization of small companies with high growth potential. The “Fundo de Sindicação de Capital de Risco (FSCR)” has attempted to strengthen the role of government equity financing programs in stimulating private enterprise activity based on co-financing and risk-sharing. In particular, with the venture capital program, aimed at technology companies Novas Empresas de Suporte Tecnológico (NEST), which was designed to encourage early stage investment in R&amp;D projects that offer new products or services. At the same time, the first venture capital funds, particularly private equity, were created as an extension of the national banking investment banking operations. In the venture capital segment, this is only developed later. In the private sector, Espírito Santo Ventures (created in 2006 owned by BES Group, had a vocation for venture capital, distinguishing itself from ES Capital or BESI internally, the latter being more oriented to private equity and M&amp;A) and Change Partners (established in 2003, based in Porto). There is also a reference to Pathena SGPS, which has previously had two cases (of the few), with successful outlets: Enabler (sold to Wipro in 2006) and Mobicomp (sold to Microsoft in 2008). From 2008 (with a peak in 2011) an increase in the number of funds and VC management firms is visible, in parallel with the creation of risk-sharing systems, either co-financed by the State and / or the European Union, within the Strategic program, namely the “Quadro de Referência Estratégico Nacional” (QREN) for the period 2007-2013. 3.2.4 Trusts Even today, particularly when considering issues such as fiduciary duties of managers, many of the concepts and principles have inspired in court decisions of the English courts to decide on management of trusts, as the important case Keech v Sandford (1724) which is recognized duties trust managers, including the duty of loyalty, where managers must prevent conflicts of interest in management. The figure of the Trust, typical of common law regimes and absent from the national regime,30 in which the Investment Funds figure is inspired, has a form of constitution: The Trust constitutes a separate fund and is not part of the assets owned by the Trustee; The title of the assets in “Trust” is in the name of the “Trustee” or on behalf of another person on behalf of the “Trustee”; The Trustee has the power and duty to employ or dispose of property in accordance with the special duties imposed by law and is therefore accountable. Thus, as essential elements, similar to the case of the Contract in favor of third person, this figure has: the manifestation of will of the Settlor; The identification and acceptance of the Trustee, the transfer of the assets to the ownership of the Trustee, the identification of the beneficiaries and intentions of distribution, temporality and revocability). In addition, management rules, succession provisions, remunerations, discretion and limitations, “Protector” are provided for ancillary purposes. Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the sum (in monetary terms) of all final goods and services produced in a given economy over a given period. GDP is one of the most used indicators in macroeconomics with the objective of quantifying the economic activity of a region or country. GDP is calculated by the following formula: GDP = C + I + G + (X-M); Where: C = Private consumption; I = Total Investments; G = Represents government expenditures; X = Is the volume of Exports and M = Volume of Imports. It was decided to use real rather than nominal GDP (which does not have the effect of inflation) and compare with EU A 28 and UK (as this is one of the systems used in the comparison throughout the present work).↩ Difference between the percentage of positive valuation responses (“increased”, “much improved”, “higher than normal”, “good”, “yes, absolutely certain”, etc.) and negative “worsened somewhat”, “very unfavorable”, “probably not”, etc.).

["the-portuguese-venture-capital-market.html", "Chapter4 The Portuguese venture capital market", " Chapter4 The Portuguese venture capital market The Portuguese Securities Market Commission (CMVM) publishes the “Venture Capital Report,”31 continuously since 2007. It was extracted all the data of each year and, afterwads a time series constructed, per each reported parameter. It should be noted that some parameters have been discontinued. What is aimed is to analyse the evolution of variables reported over time and see the differences between year 0 (year 2007) to the last available year, i.e. 2015. Except two categories, no distinction is made between investment in private equity or venture capital (such as the EVCA) does. According to the CMVM’s data, the “Venture Capital” segment, which includes “Seed Capital”, “Start-up” and “Early Stage”, in 2015, the total portfolio totaled 720.10 Million Euros which in 2007 was only 41,939 3M). Compared to “Private Equity”, which in 2015 totaled 3017.50 M Euros (where in 2007 was only 545 352 M Euros). Chart 32 - Entities registered at CMVM Considering the year 2007, as the base year (most of the charts have the initial reporting date 2007), there were 23 Investment Firms (IM) and 42 VC Funds in 2007. By 2015 (last available data) there were 37 IM´s and 85 VC Funds. It is noticeable a sharp increase in the number of funds, which doubled, as of and increase of IM’s. Chart 33 - Assets under management As the number of holdings (including shares and other investments, such as loans, supplementary capital contributions) in 2015, 772 (compared to 111 in 2007) in Venture capital were reported and 848 (compared 532 in 2007) in Private Equity, totalising 1620 holdings in 2015. The number of holdings has not increased in the same proportion of the overall amount, the last which increased significantly. Considering the year 2015, i.e., the ratio of “Shareholdings” to “Other Instruments”, the ratio was approximately ⅓ of shareholdings (total Venture Capital and Private Equity), however, in comparison with 2007, it is notorious the inversion. Table 1 - Funds and IM in activity (31/12/2015) – Investment Amount Itens 2007 2015 Shareholdings 762.891 1125 Other investments 510.174 2612.5 Total 1278.857 3737.5 / Chart 34 - Investment (Amount as 31/12/2015) Considering the value of participation (range) and the number of observations32 for the year 2015 is important to note that there is an inverse relationship between the value and the number of participations, i.e., the higher the value of the stake, the fewer observations. Another relevant fact is that this figure includes stakes in investment vehicles, such as investment units of funds. Another relevant fact is that this figure includes stakes in investment vehicles. Table 2 - Value of the Participations in the Venture Capital Holding Amount (€) Nº Obs Total Amount 0 201 €0.00 ]0-100.000[ 182 €5,201,758.60 [100.000-500.000[ 159 €42,886,096.06 [500.000-1.000.000[ 70 €47,646,934.61 [1.000.000-5.000.000[ 140 €317,754,210.64 [5.000.000-10.000.000[ 32 €226,074,532.20 [10.000.000-20.000.000[ 10 €141,912,827.56 [20.000.000-100.000.000[ 9 €342,533,821.63 &quot; &gt; 100.000.000 “ 0 Total 803 €1,124,010,181.30 For example at December 31, 2015, only a third of the holdings (value) were in Shares (803 holdings, (all holdings were in 1620), was distributed as follows: Chart 36 - Amount and Nº of participations (December 31, 2015) As can be seen, there are more participations of lower value (or null), i.e., along the x-axis and distant from the the origin. Conversely, those that have values closer to the x-axis are those that have values at y-axis are higher. As of holdings with value higher than 5M €, the number of observations is reduced, 51 (slightly more than 5%) however, account for more than half of the total value of holdings. In brief, it can be concluded that: just a ⅓ of the investment is in shareholdings and that roughly 20% has no value and as the valuation will be greater, the number of shares reduces. On the other hand, approximately 23% has a value of less than € 100,000, if we add the group of shareholdings between € 100,000 and 500,000 to the remaining two groups, we have 65% of the total number of shareholdings, totalling only 8.52% of the total investment. Thus 32.5% of the shareholdings, account for 91.48% of the investment value. Chart 37 - Number of investments per type Is also visible an increased (number, above) and amount (next chart) of investment in other instruments rather than equity. If investment in equity instruments stayed more or less stable, the was a significant increase (amount) in other instruments that comprises, among other instruments: debt instruments. Chart 38 - Amount (000€) of investments per type Chart 39 - Market Share, assets under management per entity The entity with the largest market share (by Investment Firm), is ECS - SCR, SA, from 2007 to 2015, with 30% market share in 2015 (mainly because of the Fund FCR Revitalizar, which has 980 M € under management) and still stands out Oxy Capital - SCR, SA with 20.3% of market share and Caixa Capital - SCR, SA with 10.8%, in global terms. In the venture segment, it should be noted that Portugal Ventures with 7% market share and ES Ventures with 4.5% market share (by assets under management). On the other hand it should be noted the merger of Capital Tourism, InovCapital and Aicep Capital in 2012, resulting in Portugal Ventures33: IM and the bankruptcy of Finpro34. Chart 40 - Number of Holdings per NACE Considering the sectors of economic activity, until 2007 inclusive, those with Real Estate activities constituted a considerable part of the holdings held, followed by holdings in Manufacturing Industries. As of 2008, there are more participations in Professional,scientific, technical activities and Transport and Communications activities (in which it should be noted that by 2014, transport activities had 26 participations with a value of € 207.3 million and communication had 171 participations with only 98.3 M€ value, in 2015. The number of participation in Transportation is 38.7M€, has only reduced the number of participations to 24. Communications activities have grown both regarding number and value. As of 2011, there is also an increase in non-financial interests in non-financial SGPS in a significant and not so accentuated form of the holdings in Manufacturing Industries. Chart 41 - Amount (000€) of Holdings per NACE Regarding the value of the participations, a sharp increase in the share of non-financial SGPS from 2010 onwards has slowed down and remained more or less stable from 2013 onwards, by € 1300 M (corresponding, in comparative terms to values between ⅓ and ½ to total of the value of the participations). On the other hand, there is a peak of “Production and distribution of electricity, gas and water” between 2008 and 2013 and between 2007 and 2011 in Financial activities. What is withdrawn is that the number of participations does not imply equal proportion in the value of these, that is to say, there is a small number of participations that influence significantly the total value of the participations. In addition, the biggest changes are in real estate, financial sector, SGPS, production and distribution of electricity, gas and water and, although there has been an increase in participation in manufacturing, Information and Communication and Professional,scientific, technical activities these have grown more moderate and sustained . Chart 42 Number of holdings per investment phase The “Venture Capital” segment, which comprises “Seed Capital”, “Start-up” and Early Stage “in 2015, the total portfolio amounted to 720.10 M euros (where in 2007 was only 41 939 3M). Compared to”Private Equity“, which in 2015 totaled 3017.50 (where in 2007 was only 545 352 M Euros). Chart 43 - Amounts under management per investment phase Chart 44 - Amounts under management per investment phase (Breakdown) Looking for investment phase, there are two important changes: an increase from 2008 in expansion; an increase from 2011 to turnaround operations. The amounts for total venture capital (seed, startup and Early state) are lower than the increases registered in the other two types of operations. 4.0.0.1 Exit Strategy Chart 45 - Exit Strategy (Sale Price) As already announced, there are no IPO records and considering the sale price, most have as exit strategy the sale to third parties (orange), repurchase of the management team (blue) and forward sales contracts. From 2014, also appears as a strategy to sell other FCR, as many as have not been set. Chart 46 - Exit Strategy (Number of operations) Regarding the number of transactions, the sale to third parties, the repurchase by the management team and the forward sale agreement continue to set the highest number of operations. However in 2015 an interesting phenomenon is visible: a large number of write-offs and in comparison with the previous year, of sale to other funds. Chart 47 - Average Holding period (years) The average holding period (in which most of them, being through VC Funds have a term limited to 10 years), a large part has holdings of less than four years in which the number of holdings held by less than 2 years. Chart 48 - Percentage Owned Regarding the percentage held, most have interests up to 40%, i.e. are not positions of control (less than 50%), however there has been an increase in shares greater than 10% (where this limit has implications in particular for shareholders´s loan in terms of fiscal legislation). Chart 49 - Investment Evaluation (Number of obs.) As mentioned above regarding the methodologies for valuation of holdings, the most used methods (number of participations) are discounted cash flows, acquisition value and multiples. In 2015, for example of the 1,620 reported holdings, 829 used the DCF, 391 acquisition value and 175 the market price. Chart 50 - Investment Evaluation (Amount) Looking at the amount of 3736.11M€ reported, 2336.82 M€ were evaluated using the DCF, 527.49M€ acquisition value and 290.78M€ multiples. Considering the potential gains and losses in the portfolio, participations assessed through DCF in 2015 have a potential loss of 554,011M€. Looking at the amount of 3736.11M€ reported, 2336.82 M€ were evaluated using the DCF, 527.49M€ acquisition value and 290.78M€ multiples. On the other hand these potential losses only begin to be reported in 2011. Chart 51 - Potential Capital Gains (Portfolio) When combining the valuation of the investments and the potential capital gains, as of 2011 it is clear that the value of the assets have associated potential losses, whereby in 2015, if these potential capital losses are considered to become effective, the value of the investments would have a write-off of 640 804 M € . Chart 52 - Investment Evaluation and Potential losses 4.0.0.2 Investments and divestments Chart 53 - Investments and divestments (Total) In global terms, there have been more investments (acquisitions) than divestitures (divestments), where in 2012 and 2013 there was a significant increase in divestment operations. Disaggregating by venture capital and private equity, the overall trend is similar to the private equity, yet in venture capital, there are more operations (in comparative terms) of acquisition than alienation. On the other hand it is not constant, in which 2008 and 2013 registered fewer acquisition operations. Overall, 2012 and 2013 (lasting until 2014) there were more sales transactions as compared to other years. Chart 54 - Investments and divestments (Venture Capital) Chart 55 - Investments and divestments (Private Equity) Regarding the number of operations, while the value of transactions in private equity is clearly superior to venture capital in 2011, 2013 and 2015 were even higher than those of venture capital and the remaining years, significantly below but not distinctly. Chart 56 - Investments and divestments (number of operations) Looking to investments by type, associated on the one hand the investments (total portfolio), the +/- unrealized gains (i.e. valuations and potential devaluations), net investment and introducing a new variable that is the result of the sum of the investment + (+/- potential capital gains). Chart 57 - Investments and potential devaluations As is apparent the net investment does not have any significant impact on the total value of the assets. Finally, as already noted, the type of participation changed significantly between 2007 and 2015, as can be seen in table 3 below. On the other hand, the item that increased were the “Other financing”, corresponding in 2015 to more than ⅔ of values. Table 3 Year “+/- Potential Gains Other Financing Equity Instruments 2007 -30.242 510.174 762.892 2008 -79.606 271.5 894.9 2009 -85.354 366.6 1245.1 2010 -41.6213 642.1 1369.5 2011 -278.8111 952.5 1232.9 2012 -496.524 1629.6 1096.3 2013 -738.546 1938.7 1146.8 2014 -909.7346 2307 1175.2 2015 -640.8044 2612.5 1125 Corr. Pearson -0.9374453645 0.1150192269 Making the correlation between the amounts of financing and the +/- reported capital gains, there is a strong correlation between increased funding other than in shares and the increase in other financing and otherwise there is no correlation with the shareholdings. Finally, considering contractual forward transactions, as of 2009 their number begins to decline, as the valuation of these operations (in other words, there are fewer operations, in a parametric way the valuation also decreases). Chart 58 - Futures contracted One of the major limiting factors, in addition to not reporting series, is the format in which they are available (.pdf), making harder its use or contextualization.↩ Table 7 - Value of the Participations in the Venture Capital Activity (12/31/2015), Venture Capital Report of the CMVM 2015 and Table 2.1. Amounts under management (31 December 2007)↩ There were some inconsistencies in the reporting of the Funds of these entities, namely by adding up the total assets under management of these three entities (namely Funds), the value reported to CMVM in 2015 was € 240. However, these have written of having more than 400 M € under management (but only report 240 M €). On the other hand, interestingly, AICEP, in the documentation available on the companies belonging to the Governmental Business Sector, of the General Directorate of Treasury and Finance (http://www.dgtf.pt/sector-empresarial-do-estado-see/informacao ), in 2013 (latest information available) reports these holdings in VC Funds, which were already under the management of Portugal Ventures. The same happens with the Portuguese Tourism funds (which in 2015 appear on the balance sheets of banks, e.g., the BPI). Adding the value (here by share capital, i.e., the total nominal value of the investment units) of these funds, the value will always be higher than that reported globally by Portugal Ventures. However, the biggest discrepancy in the report appears to be in private equity and real estate/tourism funds (where Turismo de Portugal, in its 2015 accounts report only notes the heavy costs in litigation - of approximately € 500,000 m€, double the amount spent on other legal services. As stated “As far as litigation is concerned, it should be noted that the trend, which has been observed in previous years, that legal recovery proceedings have taken place mainly in the form of special revitalization or insolvency proceedings, as well as the trend towards a reduction of the success of these processes, as a consequence of the regimes of provision of special guarantees of performance of obligations applicable.”, Page 82 of the Activity Report 2015 of Turismo de Portugal IP↩ Finpro had as its main shareholders Amorim (25.4%), Banif (32%), Caixa Geral de Depósitos (17.2%) and the Instituto de Gestão de Fundos de Capitalização da Segurança social (10%).

The list of recognized credit claims with the list of creditors of the company, were: Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD), claimed more than half of the credits (123.2 million), followed by BCP (40.9 million), Banif (28.9 million), Santander (12.2 million), the BIC (9.2 million) and Caixa Central de Crédito Agrícola (six million euros).↩ "],
["investment-forms-used-in-portugal.html", "Chapter5 Investment forms used in Portugal 5.1 Investiment 5.2 Data - Options and justification of its treatment 5.3 Descriptive statistics 5.4 Parties 5.5 Ecosystem structure", " Chapter5 Investment forms used in Portugal 5.1 Investiment First of all, there are no official systematised data on the type of contracts carried out, or the instruments used, since the information is scarce and contradictory (removing some references in case studies). It is usually used the paper of Steven N. Kaplan, Per Stromberg “Financial Contracting Theory Meets the Real World: An Empirical Analysis of Venture Capital Contracts”, 2000.35 The authors analyse 200 investment in venture capital of 118 target companies of 14 investment firms. The data source was the investment firms themselves. This hypothesis was attempted and was unsuccessful. Considering that this type of events can also be observed through other external signs, namely through the mandatory publications (i.ee the validity of certain events, depend on their externalisation, i.e. publication). Thus it was resorted to different sources (and some were removed, explained in the annexes in more detail the methodology, as well as the obstacles found and the way of resolving them). Considering the data collected, the following questions were asked: The form, i.e., whether through entry in equity, shareholder´s loan, or other instruments using securitized instruments were commonly used; Total investment, as it was distributed among the various instruments available. The changes in share capital from the initial intervention; Date of incorporation of the targeted companies and the date of (initial) investment; The existence of classes of shares of the ratio for the common shares The NACE of these companies; The number of investors and how they split (between Venture Capital and others, as BA’s and Enterprises (syndication); The migration of some companies to other jurisdictions; The existence of exits (including cases of dissolution); The use of bonds and other securitized instruments, particularly after the amendment to limit the issuance of bonds in 2015; The total investment that was financed through risk-sharing instruments and the amount; The sample is composed of 180 (175 national and 5 that referred to in point h), i.e. that although there is a company established in Portugal, investment in all or a certain point is carried out in a company where there is a relationship of domain or group, or the same shareholders and even trademarks and preferred to add those and not allocate that investment to the domestic company). Derived from these still calculated: Other equity instruments / equity (total share capital increase - shareholders’ entry (natural persons)); Ratio Other instruments / equity share capital assigned to investors [total share capital increase - shareholders’ entry (natural persons) entries] Derivation of debt to equity, which due to a considerable part is through funds that require that 70% of the investment is in equity and no entry in the share capital of that order is visible, it will have to be assumed that there are additional entries. Which in some cases is visible, in the in-kind entries, through conversion). On the other hand falls within the CMVM classification, which adds to “Other instruments” and “Entries through share Capital.” Compared to the CMVM aggregate data (which sums participations, per fund), as already analysed in 2015 there would be 720 participations in venture capital. In total, in 2015, there were 734 in equity, 815 in other investments and 71 in investment units of Funds. Whereas it is reported by an entity, the same company (object) being the subject of co-investment, will see all these reported holdings. If the investment is not made through equity, at least one other type of instrument (in which they report number of participations, by type), considering that the investment - or part of it - is not reported as “other financing”. The only exception that can be discerned is the issuance of securities (such as bonds), because the same rule of publicity applies to entries in the share capital of companies. Unlike the share capital, which is always possible to know the amendments, the same does not apply to other financing. This is always referred to as “Total Reported Investment” in order to clarify that the amounts are known and the possibility of more unreported financing has to be considered. Even using data from PME Investimentos (which reports the entire investment in the co-funded entity), Crunchbase, which derive from press releases or changes made by management companies themselves, the value of information from public registries is always higher, as of audited accounts. On the other hand, one of the reasons for cross-referencing and using different sources was, on the other hand, not privileging those that are reported (i.e. those that depend essentially on the willingness of more or less publicity of the parties), not only considering those that had financing Public, which would be an underrepresentation of the totality existing, and finally try to obtain a representative sample of all funds (or companies). It was preferred to allocate by investment fund (and only then allocate these funds to the respective management companies). In the event that it is not possible to determine, it was allocated to the management entity. Except for the 5 cases mentioned above, there were no investments made in foreign companies, in which only the largest number will be found in ES Ventures. As mentioned, withdrawing occasional cases (in which or the participations are still in the FCR or by reinforcement of the investment), did not look for investments previous to 2006, for reasons already announced. It is possible that the figures for 2015 will be higher because there is a delay in the disclosure of information, namely if it is the first time investment has been made and it has not been disclosed. The last verification and updating of data was in September 2016, when no investments or reinforcements were considered in 2016 until that date. 5.2 Data - Options and justification of its treatment The various options available for treatment of “missing values”, it was opted for the multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) R package, the method used was classification and regression trees (CART). Most methods use the mean, or other measure of normally distributed data, to make the imputation. Faced with a series in which dispersion measures have extreme behaviors, particularly in tails, these methods are not ineffective. On the other hand, methods that assume the standard deviation, namely with values close to 0, end up returning negative results, where, i.e., as would output negative investment, which would not be possible. Finally, the option of eliminating also influences the sample, i.e., since it is already a reduced sample, to eliminate all that do not have one of the parameters, would end up under representing a certain group. The method can be found on section “7. Data sources and Treatment” 5.3 Descriptive statistics It is present below a summary of significant statistical measures, as well as the graphical representation of each variable distribution function. As regards the graphic representation, it preferred to use the values without any conversion, as histograms was added to the distribution function (Y axis). Considering the distribution, the median (dashed line in orange) was also drawn, and the lines along the x-axis represent the frequency of occurrences of each variable at a given point on the x-axis. The second Chart is the empirical cumulative density function (ECDF). 5.3.1 Incorporation Year Chart 59 - Incorporation Year (Probability Density Function) Chart 60 - Incorporation Year (ECDF) Table 4 - Summary Statistics (Year of Incorporation) ## Min. 1st Qu.

In most cases, the relative interest of the investor is less than 50% of the share capital, however, it is also possible to observe that most cases use different classes of shares (with special rights in relation to the common shares). The use of other instruments such as bonds or warrants is reduced (only 5 cases out of 175). Most of the investments are in companies with a few years of life and in NACE - Information and communication activities. Finally, there are few disinvestment events (including dissolution). Of the few known cases, there is sale of participation to other funds (MBO’s), the merger in which the terms of exchange are shares of the acquiring company and dissolution. 5.4 Parties 5.4.1 Investors characterisation Investors in this type of operation can be classified as qualified and non-qualified investors. For the purpose of this analysis, only qualified investors will be considered. Article 30.º of the Portuguese Securities Code defines the entities that are considered to be qualified investors in that in this case, the risk capital companies constitute a “collective investment institutions and their management companies, as is listed in subheading c) of that article). It should be noted, particularly in the case of pension funds36, that there is an indirect investment, of retail investors in this type of investment through the last subscription in the first. However, taking into account the level of risk, the weight of this type of investment should be relatively small in the total pension fund portfolio. There will not be examined collective investments “Crowdfunding”, but also represents a raising of retail investors’ savings (which limits one million € in total and 3000 € for investors in the case of investors with income below 70 000 € in the form of “collective loan”. It is only note that one of the arguments for the restriction of certain options was the protection of retail investors, and be permitted to raise capital collectively of small investors (in similar amounts to the venture capital , particularly in the early stages), it will be difficult to support the harmonization of this scheme with the need to ensure that investment is not sold indirectly to the general public.37 According to EVCA, the largest investors in venture capital in 2015 were: government agencies (31%), corporate Investors (14%) and funds of funds (7%)38. In Portugal, according to CMVM, most of the invested capital is concentrated in five entities. It should also denote the presence of funds set up with public funds, concentrated today under the umbrella of Portugal Ventures (which holds 17 and in 2015 there was a concentration of management and merger of funds venture capital funds) in which the Caixa Capital, owned Caixa Caixa de Depósitos (100% public) was excluded from this merger. In Europe, according to EVCA this trend is also visible. Considering the total number (and the value of subscription39) of all funds were considered 30 venture capital funds that have in their investment policy, invest in the segment “venture capital”, by calculating the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI ), it is possible to assess, on the one hand it is a very concentrated industry,40 and Portugal Ventures and Espírito Santo Ventures are major players. Thus, the following funds were considered and their value calculated:41 Table 21 - VC Funds Management Entity Fund Amount Year ES Ventures SCR, SA FCR ESV II 88.00 2006 ES Ventures SCR, SA FCR ESV III 77.00 2009 ES Ventures SCR, SA FCR ESV Inovação &amp; Internacionalização 10.00 2011 ES Ventures SCR, SA FCR ISTART - I 3.00 2011 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA FCR Portugal Ventures Universitas 3.72 2011 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA FCR Portugal Ventures Early Stages 7.17 2011 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA FCR Portugal Ventures ACTEC II 7.78 2011 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA FCR Portugal Ventures Indústrias Criativas 6.00 2011 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA FCR Portugal Ventures Turismo Inovação 6.00 2011 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA FCR Portugal Ventures Internacionalização 14.22 2011 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA FCR Portugal Ventures Biocant 4.00 2011 Critical Ventures SCR, SA FCR Critical Ventures I 7.00 2011 Change Partners SCR, SA FCR Fast Change 9.00 2003 Change Partners SCR, SA FCR Fast Change II 5.00 2011 Beta Capital SCR, SA FCR Beta Ciências da Vida 2.50 2011 2BPARTNER SCR, SA FCR Minho Inovação e Internacionalização 4.00 2011 ISQ SCR, SA FCR ASK Celta 10.00 2011 ISQ SCR, SA FCR ASK Capital 11.00 2011 Novabase Capital SCR, SA FCR Novabase Inovação e Internacionalização 11.36 2011 Novabase Capital SCR, SA FCR Novabase Capital 7.14 2005 Caixa Capital SCR, SA FCR Empreender Mais 25.00 2009 Caixa Capital SCR, SA FCR Caixa Tech Transfer Accelerator Ventures 6.00 2015 Capital Criativo SCR, SA FCR Capital Criativo I 20.50 2011 ES Ventures SCR, SA FCR F-HITEC 3.50 2 008 Beta Capital SCR, SA FCR Beta Early Stages 2.50 2005 Pathena Pathena SICAR 55.80 2012 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA FCR Portugal Global Ventures 20.37 1999 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA Portugal Ventures Global 2 23.18 2015 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA Portugal Ventures Finicia 4.00 2007 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA Portugal Ventures FIAEA 1.10 2011 Portugal Ventures SCR, SA asset rotation 30.30 2015 Total 486.15 Chart 85 - VC Market share per Amounts under Management It is therefore considered that the total value of FCRs is 486.15 million euros. One of the potential explanations of the gap between value under management and value of UP’s, has to do with: A)“Double counting”, ie when the assets under management report, consider the total value of the assets, even if only hold a very small part of that asset. In the case of investment through investment units, they are doubly reported. For example: Figure 8 - Double counting In the case of investment in venture capital, the weight of funds held by government entities (which are not accounted for as SCR, or would have to appear to PME Investimentos, fund manager FINOVA), or which raise public or national capital , Or European. This detail is important, especially when analyzing incentives and disinvestment strategies, such as the limitations imposed in the investment policy regarding the instruments used (in the case of funds with ERDF contribution (via FINOVA participation), there are limits on the investment per entity, As almost all of them have as a condition “At least 70% of the FCR’s participation in each project must be guaranteed by capital or quasi-capital”, which is maintained in the Capital and Near Capital Fund (FC &amp; QC)42, managed by IFD - Financeira de Desenvolvimento, SA, within the scope of the Financial Instrument for Financing to Venture Capital Funds. Depending on the criterion, they may consider the assets under management in which they include the deposits and other instruments assigned to the venture capital activity, as they may consider the subscribed and unrealized capital “; On the other hand, some venture capital funds can increase the initial capital (which can be either via divestment capital or by strengthening the units). It should also be noted that it is changes are visible, particularly arising from the operations of the banks resolution procedures (BPN, BCP, BES) and the restructuring and merger of Governmental funds, in June 2012, resulting from the merger of three Capital Companies Risk in Portugal - AICEP Capital (incorporated in 1988), InovCapital (incorporated in 1989) and Turismo Capital (incorporated in 1991).43: Thus, considering only the funds mentioned above, in order to characterize the Venture Capital investors (disregarding the BA’S and ICR lines), it is not only a predominance of funds managed by Portugal Ventures, but also a Part of them is co-financed44 (through public instruments, notably within Compete (Finova). Chart 86 - Sankey diagram A treemap was constructed, in which the area corresponds to the endowment of funds by investment management firms and the color gradation (from gray to green), the years in which they were constituted, where gray corresponds to the oldest and green to newest. Chart 87 - treemap ## Warning in data.frame(group, value, color): row names were found from a ## short variable and have been discarded ES Ventures and Change Partners are those with mature (older) funds, although although much of Portugal Ventures’ funds are recent, it also has older funds. The same is true in Beta Capital and Novabase Capital. As already was visible in the Sankey diagram, the ES Ventures and Pathena are those that have managed funds with larger endowment, especially above 30M €, between the band of 15-20 M € out to Portugal Ventures, Caixa Capital, Capital Criativo. The rest have most values below € 10M. Considering the HHI45 \\[H = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{q_i^2}\\] Where \\(qi\\) is the market share of firm \\(i\\) in the market, and \\(N\\) is the number of firms. Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI): * 2396.6 (all referenced funds) * 3058.4 (all registered with the CMVM, ie except Pathena SICAR) Whereas: Low Concentrated Market: HHI below 1500 Moderately concentrated market: HHI between 1500 and 2500 Very concentrated markets: HHI above 2500 As information of support mechanisms, most, with the exception of the BES and the old IAPMEI, AICEP Capital and TC Capital (the latter being also funded under the previous financial framework) almost all the funds had as co-financing the FINOVA. In Portugal, as it is visible, the type of investors can be divided into: credit and financial institutions; Government (which includes public business sector); Corporate Venture; In the case of Venture Capital, the following categories may be added: Business Angels (or ICR), where it is visible, particularly when looking at participants in the funding rounds and also receiving two lines of funding under SAPRI. University (where they appear as investors through companies owned by them46); 5.4.2 Promoters Profile 5.4.2.1 Characterisation of founders/entrepreneurs It is also important to characterize the promoters, particularly as regards their risk profile and expectations. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor47 data and using as a comparison the United Kingdom and the United States (both common law countries) were considered the following indicators of the reporting period (up to the last available). 5.4.2.1.1 Activity Total early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) Percentage of 18-64 population who are either a nascent entrepreneur or owner-manager of a new business Chart 88 - Total early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) New Business Ownership Rate Percentage of 18-64 population who are currently a owner-manager of a new business, i.e., owning and managing a running business that has paid salaries, wages, or any other payments to the owners for more than three months, but not more than 42 months Chart 89 - New Business Ownership Rate Improvement-Driven Opportunity Entrepreneurial Activity: Relative Prevalence Percentage of those involved in TEA who (i) claim to be driven by opportunity as opposed to finding no other option for work; and (ii) who indicate the main driver for being involved in this opportunity is being independent or increasing their income, rather than just maintaining their income Chart 90 - Improvement-Driven Opportunity Entrepreneurial Activity: Relative Prevalence 5.4.2.1.2 Aspirations Growth Expectation early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity: Relative Prevalence Percentage of TEA who expect to employ at least five employees five years from now Chart 91 - Growth Expectation early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity: Relative Prevalence International Orientation early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity Percentage of TEA who indicate that at least 25% of the customers come from other countries Chart 92 - International Orientation early-stage Entrepreneurial Activity 5.4.2.2 Attitudes and Perceptions Entrepreneurial Intention Percentage of 18-64 population (individuals involved in any stage of entrepreneurial activity excluded) who intend to start a business within three years Chart 93 - Entrepreneurial Intention Fear of Failure Rate Percentage of 18-64 population with positive perceived opportunities who indicate that fear of failure would prevent them from setting up a business Chart 94 - Fear of Failure Rate Media Attention for Entrepreneurship Percentage of 18-64 population who agree with the statement that in their country, you will often see stories in the public media about successful new businesses Chart 95 - Media Attention for Entrepreneurship The existence of an increase, almost overlapping with the US, of those who define themselves as opportunistic (as opposed to those who have no other alternative option in working); which indicated that the main vector to engage an opportunity is given the opportunity to be independent and increase its performance, instead of keeping the actual yield. The “fear of failing” Fear to Failure Rate “, revise it higher to Portugal, compared to these two countries. Compared with other data, on potential “entrepreneurs”: Considering the human capital available, in general terms, only a third of the population has higher education and not necessarily in STEAM (which is around 20% of the number of students entering higher education). On the other hand, most companies consists of fewer than 10 employees (see above). Even in business births, with at least one paid person the number drops to ⅙. Although the survey GEM enter the “will” or intentions, it seems that resistance to the concentration of companies, remains as much of the established companies will be in reality what is called “self-employment”. If adding the innovation scoreboards (if removing the registration of trademarks and other annual operating subsidies), it is still not visible a fact of investment-oriented innovation in general (which can be measured both by the investment such as the hiring of specialized human resources). On the other hand, it is not visible a considerable increase in the number of companies, where in some years even existed a net growth, not, so the intent reflected in this indicator. Considering the driver, indicated the possibility of increasing income, where: most sectors had negative net results and can not earn an income either through dividends or other form of reimbursement. Important to note that in 2011, the minimum share capital for Corporation shares rose from € 5,000 to € 148. One argument was that it could restrict or negatively encourage the incorporation of new companies. On the other hand, the process of opening (“empresa na hora”49) and of extinction (“dissolução e liquidação na hora” i that allows the extinction and immediate liquidation of companies) have simpler and faster processes with the “empresa na hora”. However, they are only possible for pre-approved bylaws, as in the case of liquidation, these can not have accounts to be settled with external creditors. 5.5 Ecosystem structure As was announced earlier, would be considered the actors, as the contracts between these two over time. Whereas the system under analysis, the theory of complex systems50 has as its objective the connections between several objects, usually dynamically. As explained by W. Brian Arthur (2013) corresponds to the intermediate layer between the macro economy, ie, the aggregate behavior of a given economy and of the casuistic analysis. One of the most used in the analysis of complex systems tools is to look at the structure of the system as a whole, using graph theory51. One of the advantages of this method is the possibility of easily visualizing the connections and interdependence of several elements in a given system, such as the evolution and dynamics of networks. 5.5.1 Graph Theory In the case under analysis, the agents correspond to the nodes (also called vertices) and the links between these two agents, the edges (directed or not). A graph corresponds to the set of all nodes and edges that link them. Thus, for the graph \\((G)\\), there are two pairs of sets. A finite non-empty set composed of nodes \\(N (G)\\) connected together by a predefined set of edges \\(E (G)\\). Formally described as: \\(G = (N, E)\\) Wherein for the graph: nodes = \\({A, B, C, D, E}\\) edges = \\(({A, B}, {A, C}, {B, C}, {C, E})\\) It can be graphically represented as follows: ## ## Attaching package: &#39;igraph&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:plotly&#39;: ## ## groups ## The following objects are masked from &#39;package:stats&#39;: ## ## decompose, spectrum ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:base&#39;: ## ## union If the edges are directed: \\(G = (N, E)\\) \\(Nodes = {A, B, C, D, E}\\) Edges = \\(((A, B),(A, C),(B, C),(C, E))\\) In which graphically the edges have arrows, indicating its direction: Adjacency Matrix The adjacency relationships between the nodes are described by a matrix (the adjacency matrix associated with the graph). It is a square matrix, whose order 𝑛 corresponds to the number of nodes that the graph has; each row and each column of this matrix corresponds to a node in the graph. The elements of this matrix are associated with the structural data of the graph \\(𝐺 (N, E)\\). These elements have non-zero values when there are links between the nodes corresponding to the elements and null values otherwise. When treating a weighted graph in which edges have weights (e.g. distance, investment), the values of non-zero elements of the adjacency matrix receive the weight of the edge. For unweighted graphs, nonzero elements are given a value of 1 (which was the chosen option). For the above case the adjacency matrix of the graph (G) is: \\[G=\\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp;1 &amp;1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\\\ 1&amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;0 &amp;0 \\\\ 1&amp;1 &amp;0 &amp;0 &amp; 1\\\\ 0&amp; 0 &amp;0 &amp; 0 &amp;0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp;1 &amp;0 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\] In undirected graph, the adjacency matrix is symmetric along the main diagonal (e.g. in the case of looping of one directed edge, this rule is not true). An incidence matrix computationally represents a graph through a bidimensional matrix, where one of the dimensions are nodes and the other dimension are edges. Given a graph \\(G\\) with \\(n\\) nodes and \\(m\\) edges, we can represent it in an \\(n × m\\) matrix of \\(G\\). Similarly, the size of \\(G\\) is the cardinality of \\(E (G)\\), that is, the total number of edges \\(m\\). 5.5.1.1 Basic concepts Order (of a graph) - total number of nodes. Dimension (of a graph) - total number of edges. Graph density - 2E /N, where E is the number of edges and E o of edges. A graph with E edges has, at most, E (E-1) / 2 edges. A graph that has a number of edges near the maximum number is said to be dense. Regular graph - if case all nodes of the graph have the same number of edges (or same degree of the edges). Sub-graph - subset of nodes and edges of the graph, that is, graphically, we have two graphs. But since these two graphs are part of the same network, we are in the presence of a subgraph of the main graph. Distance - distance measured between two or more nodes, through the number of edges that separate them. Connectivity - means whether or not there is a connection between any locations Circuit - is a closed path that starts and ends at the same node, without passing through the same path twice. Path - linear path in which no nodes appears more than once, a series of edges such that each (except the first and the last) has a common node with the previous bow and a further common edge with the following; Path length - is the number of edges that the chain has. Open Path - it is the one that finishes and ends in different nodes. Incoherent Network or tree - network where there are no circuits. Complex network - network with multiple circuits. Eulerian circuit - is a circuit that allows to visit all the vertices at least once and that goes through all the edges only once. Eulerian path - is a path that contains all edges and goes to all nodes. Hamiltonian circuit - path that passes through each node at least once. Click - is a group of nodes of a subgraph in which all the pairs of nodes are connected to each other, that is, all the vertices are neighbors of each other. Communities (hubs) - These are characterized by the high number of connections they have. Of course, the hubs are the main source of dissemination of information as they are those who can share information more easily and to a greater number of nodes. Here one can also introduce the concept of Authority or Authorities, vertices that are issuers or many edges receivers. This concept only applies in directed graphs. 5.5.1.2 Statistical measures The study or analysis that is done to a network has as main objective to identify and to understand the behavior of the system that originated the network. The measures can be divided according to the type of analysis that is to be carried out, that is, if the analysis is done at the level of a node, allowing to discover its importance in the network in general or, if the analysis is done at the level of the own network, identifying global network structure characteristics and behavior that generated it.52 5.5.1.2.1 Measurements at node level Degree of Centrality (also defined as Prestige) - of a node in a determined graph. The relative importance (degree of influence) of a node in the set. This is defined as the number of edges at a given node. If directed it can be classified as: Indegree Centrality - number of edges directed to this node; Outdegree Centrality - number of edges that depart from this node. Betweenness centrality - allows to measure how much a given node is between other nodes of the network. This measure allows to infer if a node occupies a critical position in the network, that is, if the communication between different groups passes through this node. A node with a high degree of intermediation occupies a key position in a network and is usually called a gatekeeper. It is equal to the number of shortest paths from all node to all others who pass through this node. Closeness centrality - It is a measure that allows to discover the position of a node in a network, i.e., how close is the remaining nodes this node is from network. This measure is given by the average of all the shortest paths between a node and the remaining nodes of the network. Eigenvector Centrality - measures the importance of a node in a network taking into account its connections with other nodes, assigning them a relative score according to the nodes to which they are connected. Clustering coefficient - Is a measure that allows to identify the transitivity of the neighborhood of a given node. By transitivity is understood the level of cohesion between the neighbors (adjacent vertices) of a given nodes. 5.5.1.2.2 Measurements at network level Measures at the network level make it possible to identify characteristics of the overall structure of the network and the behavior that generated it. Network diameter - is given by the maximum eccentricity value of the network nodes while the network radius is obtained through the minimum value. Average geodesic distance - allows an indication of the degree of distance from the nodes (on average). Average grade - is the average of the degree of all the nodes of the network, so it can be used to measure the global connectivity of the network (Oliveira &amp; Gama, 2010). Reciprocity - is a measure that is used specifically for directed networks and that allows to measure the tendency of vertices to form mutual connections with each other. Although there are several ways of calculating this most commonly used measure is calculating the ratio between number of mutual connections in the network and the total number of edges. Density - is a measure that allows to explain the general level of edges in a network. This metric is obtained by the quotient of the number of network connections on the maximum possible number of edges. For networks without edges it assumes a value of 0, while for fully connected networks it assumes the value of 1. Fully connected networks can also be called complete graphs or clicks. The measurement of the density of the network, varying between 0 and 1 allows to determine the general level of connections in the network. Average Clustering Coefficient - In analogy with its local counterpart, allows to calculate the transitivity of the whole network. Although there are several ways to do this calculation the one adopted in this work was proposed by Watts and Strogatz in which the average agglomeration coefficient is given by the average of the local agglomeration coefficients of all the nodes of the network. Network resilience - This network property consists of the resilience of a network relative to the removal of its nodes. It reflects the impact on network connectivity and serves as an indicator of network cohesion. When connections in a network are removed the length. This concept and this measure are extremely useful, for example in an analysis of the degree of vulnerability of the network. Being able to identify which nodes and edges(s) that in the case of, “failure” or “disappearance”, have the consequence of graph breaking and interruption of any type of flows. Modularity - Allows the detection and definition of communities in a network. There are several algorithms applied to detect communities such as hierarchical agglomeration, block modeling, Girvan-Newman, Blondell, among others. A community consists of a group of nodes that are very close to each other (McSweeney, 2009). Dynamic networks - the absence of a definition of dynamic network can be divided by different attributes, in which the most used, is the time attribute (also referred to as networks temporal), where in reality they are a particular type of a dynamic network) . Multi-mode means that there are several types of vertices, for example, startups and investment funds and multi-link refers to the possibility of several types of connections on the same network, for example investment in startups and investments in LP´s. 5.5.2 Characterisation of the Ecosystem structure Considering the data of the sample referred to in this Chapter (investment forms used in Portugal), it was added the foreign companies that invested in VC Funds, as well as others who have invested in those target companies. Were also collected incorporation of the dates or constitution (x) as well as the start date of the relationship of the vectors (x) and the end date (y): It was not known the closure of the entity, assuming that it was of \\([x, +\\propto]\\), knowing itself was of [x, y]. The same applies to edges. The nodes were classified by type: Targeted companies (startups); Venture Capital Funds ; Limited Partners (LPs)/SCR´s; Limited Partners (LPs)/SCR´s - Outside PT; SPV´s; Corporate; Universities; Banks; Other. They were also classified by: NACE; Country of origin; The Edges, (directed), were also classified, type of connection by : Investment; VC Fundraising; Management entity (or controlling entity); Thus the system consists of: “” Absolute number Target Companies 206 VC Funds 50 Limited Partners (LPs)/SCR´s 18 Limited Partners (LPs)/SCR´s - Outside PT 30 SPV´s 49 Corporate 22 Universities 5 Banks 3 Other 41 Edges 595 Investment in startups 451 VC Fundraising 91 Management entity (or controlling entity) 53 Considering that some entities (the oldest being the University of Porto), were actually constituted before 2000, in which no significant records were observed, is illustrated53 from 2000, in which this year the entities that already they were constituted. Graph 1 - Network evolution 2000-2015 Considering the evolution of the number of nodes as edges, for 5-year intervals: Between 2000 and 2015, no major changes are visible, in which there are some clusters, namely Portugal Ventures (then PME Capital), and Change Partners. Graph 2 - 2000 Between 2000 and 2015, no major changes are visible, in which there are some clusters, namely Portugal Ventures (then PME Capital), and Change Partners. As it is visible and already detected, between 2005 and 2010 it is possible to see an increase of interconnections, as well as of actors, maintaining the growth trend until 2015. Graph 3 - 2005 Graph 4 - 2010 Graph 5 - 2015 5.5.2.1 Network Metrics Average Degree: 1.408 Chart 96 - Degree Distribution In Degree Distribution and out Degree Distribution Chart 97 - In Degree Distribution Chart 98 - Out Degree Distribution Chart 99 - Prestige Interior (Number of directly connected vertices) Modularity (has no edge weight, ie the weight of each is 1)54 Modularity: 0.698 Number of hubs: 16 Chart 99 - Size Distribution Graph Distance (directed)55 Diameter: 4 Radius: 0 Average path distance 1.864968152866242 PageRank:56 parameters Epsilon = 0.001 Probability = 0.85 Chart 101 - PageRank Chart 102 - Eigenvector Centrality (directed) Distribution Number of interactions: 100 Sum change: 0.06208604213327456 Clustering Coefficient Average Clustering Coefficient: 0.014 5.5.2.2 Dynamic network Number of nodes over time (t2016 = 424). Chart 103 - Nodes Time Series Number of edges over time (t2016 = 595). Chart 104 - Edges Time Series Clustering Coefficient Chart 105 - Dynamic Clustering Coefficient As it is visible in the graphs, the nodes relative to VC Funds have more connections (edges), than those of the target companies (which are only recipients of funds). The nodes with the highest relative importance are, as expected, Portugal Ventures and FINOVA. Considering that they are directed edges, if these two nodes are removed, the larger of the target companies would not have financing. As it is visible the existing communities have as node connector (where they pass more edges) the VC Funds and their managing entities. Increases are seen for both actors (nodes) and links (edges) over time. On the other hand, there is no renewal, that is, if the edge is maintained it is because there was no divestment (the link remains). The higher the Coefficient of Agglomeration over time, the greater the increase of the ecosystem, still looking to node average clustering is clear that VC funds have a higher coefficient than target companies (less number of connected nodes). If there was a renewal (or in the case in the case in question), this coefficient would be more or less constant. This data is in line with the amounts under management in venture capital reported by the CMVM, in which this phenomenon is visible.

Decree-Law no. 225/2015 of October 9. The Capital and Near Capital Fund (FC &amp; QC) is € 146,900,000.00 (one hundred and forty-six million and nine hundred thousand euros), corresponding only to the European Regional Development Fund component, to be carried out in cash. In accordance with the number 1 of Article 5 (Composition of the portfolio), the following assets may be included in the FC &amp; QC portfolio: a) Parties representing the capital stock of companies, namely shares and quotas; B) Bonds issued by private entities; C) Credits granted to commercial companies whose activity is included in the objectives and actions to be financed by FC &amp; QC; (D) participation and equity units of venture capital companies, venture capital investment organizations, specialized alternative investment organizations and other funds for the implementation of public policies; (E) participation of venture capital syndication funds, funds invested by the European Investment Fund and other funds for the implementation of public policies; F) Option contracts inherent to risk capital operations; G) Liquidity, on an ancillary basis.

On the other hand, when reporting the investment, FCR Turismo Inovação’s investments were also financed through FINOVA (Compete), as were the remainder in 2011 through SAPFRI). Finally, a rotation of assets (besides divestment) held directly by SCR for FCRs was also made in 2015. However, the% of direct disinvestment is not 100%, because it had no match in a reduction to 100% in the portfolio value.

["conclusion.html", "Chapter6 Conclusion 6.1 Main insights 6.2 According to available data, account should be taken:", " Chapter6 Conclusion 6.1 Main insights VC investment in Portugal relies, mostly on public funds with an absence of evidence of return of investment adjusted to risk. Comparing, there are few “high growth companies” and they seem to be in economic areas different that the invested ones. Unlike the idea that all VC deals are different, data show that same degree and forms of investments are used, not in equity instruments, rather in debt instruments. The use of typical instruments of public liability company, as securities are not used, besides issuance of shares. There is also no evidence that the change on share capital requirement created a significant change in the number of companies. In spite of a lot of promotion of “startups”, results are yet to be demonstrated. The last of buy side also seems to be a contact, where exists are mostly trough outside countries. The concentration of the market share in few players (most being public funded) also contracts with an idea of market based, but rather policy based. Incentives are drawn by regulation (and funding of State), not market. The rolling of this assets seems also to be an issue, where no cash (as a fungible and more liquid asset) seems to be realized, rather selling stats to other funds, for reimbursement of the first. Most observations are not even distributed, meaning that a small percentage have a higher weight than the most frequent ones. It´s a typical case of extreme value distributions, with highly skewed distributions. 6.2 According to available data, account should be taken: No IPO’s (between the period 2007 to 2015 there are 0 occurrences of this form of disinvestment), even considering the total capital (venture capital and private equity), being able to conclude that there is a weak depth of Capital markets; The Government (directly and indirectly) as one of the major players, where in the investment policy is visible the limitations on the instruments used, as well as on the location and investment area. It can be stated that the investment, is in line with structural support funds (Compe case, QREN and currently P2020). 6.2.1 Future work ## ## Attaching package: &#39;evd&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:igraph&#39;: ## ## clusters "],
["annexes.html", "Chapter7 Annexes", " Chapter7 Annexes Notes Portugal Ventures There were several inconsistencies between the Funds reports from 2012 to 2015 (latest available), particularly in assets under management. Taking into consideration the merger, extinction and spin-off of several funds, it is important to take into account that, according to data from Portugal Ventures, it manages “Funds under management: (approximately) € 400 million.” (Turismo de Portugal, FAI and some of the AICEP), but this is a management entity and has a double criterion in reports that, on the one hand, it reports (in particular to assess the capital gains of FAI Energia), but it is completely omitted and does not, in fact, include all the assets under management.

It should also be noted that the investment units of these funds are in many cases reflected in the accounts of other entities (where they correctly put the nominal value and the valuations or impairments, such as the percentage held of the VC Fund). In the latter case, there are no changes in the value of the asset (in which many only put the acquisition price) as significant as reported by Portugal Ventures (some may differ by almost 50M €, i.e. more than 25% from one year to another). The Portugal Ventures, with visible and is reported in the financial reports, is an investment change process, which is divesting of Private Equity Units and to invest (foresees maintaining the trend) to focus on Venture Capital. In fact, as of 12/31/2015, of a portfolio of € 240, they consider their portfolio, broadly divided as follows: Number of companies Number of companies Portfolio 2014 2015 VC 68 89 PE T&amp;LT 19 11 PE E&amp;M 22 17 Investment (acquisition cost) Asset valuation Seed 58.8 58.3 Startup 77.1 58.3 Growth Capital 42.7 41.6 Outros 36.6 22.5 N/A 0.8 Portugal Ventures Annual Report 2015, page 48, Fig. 25 European Venture Capital Association (EVCA) Reports the data between 2007 and 2015, according to CMVM, but the method is different. It uses data provided by representative risk capital entities in each country. In the case of Portugal, the data are supplied by the Portuguese Association of Venture Capital and Development (APCRI). The APCRI sample is also very weak (compared to the CMVM); In which due to having such a small number of observations, any change in one of the variable has a great impact. In fact, comparing the data of the CMVM with those of the EVCA, the discrepancies are notorious, namely in two key parameters: number of venture capital firms and amount reported.

Records relating to the appointment and termination of functions were not taken into account; the deposit of annual accounts and the change of the company’s headquarters, where they constitute a significant number of decisions published, but with little relevance to the analysis of the structure of capital of companies. It were extracted from the records relating to 175 companies referenced as an object of investment (own site of venture capital companies; PME Investimento e Crunchbase), for a total of 1179 events were analyzed. After analysis, 754 relevant occurrences were validated (for example, the same fact described “update” can either have a mere correction of a name, or as an amendment to the articles of incorporation, with only the last one being validated). From these validated records, the relevant and systematically reported elements were extracted into classes, namely: Share capital; Increase, number of shares (or quotas), nominal value, object, Economic activity (CAE) (in which they were extracted through the fiscal number “NIF”), type of fact reported; Date (assuming that of the publication as it appears in the register in the Ministry of Justice, modality and form of subscription, categories if they exist, the number of ordinary shares and the other classes referred thereto, if referenced, were recorded.

Namelely: Clustering and similarity; majority rule; relevance of sources (or weighting and ranking, etc.) Considering the structure and reliability of the different sources: MJ and PME Investimento are official sources and are more relevant than the others; Financial Accounts report are audited accounting documents and official; Finally, Crunchbase depends on (usually) investors completing the data and, like CB Insights, using press releases or other signals that depend, both parties wanting to promote or not the financing round. On the other hand, it has many data without variables (amount of funding). Thus: First cases were solved that only had 1 investor and were verified the dates of investments (or rounds). It is considered that if there is more than one investor, the round of the others, will be of equal value. For cases not financed by FINOVA, the percentage reported in the financial statements and the acquisition (or nominal) value and transactions between related parties were also used. Only for the cases that there is no support value, we used MCMC, using the remaining validated sample. ## NIF Incorporation..t0.

Where it reads: “The financing gap for venture capital for the promotion of qualified entrepreneurship is between € 292 and € 659 million.” Instituição Financeira de Desenvolvimento, S.A. - Decreto-Lei n.º 225/2015: Cria o Fundo de Capital e Quase Capital Creates the Capital and Quasi Capital Fund Notes Interestingly both the CMVM (as most recently Portugal Ventures in its management report) use these series in their analysis, as there are references to “portfolio valuation methods” in the preamble of the new RJCR) passing to admit the use of methodologies internationally recognized, particularly those accepted by the European Private Equity &amp; Venture Capital Association (EVCA). On a positive note, it makes a distinction between private equity and venture capital, it makes the data available in excel format. But little can be inferred from that sample, particularly in the case of data from Portugal, due to not having a sufficient number of observations and the problems mentioned above. In a first approach we have attempted to assess whether it would be possible to see if the behavior of the curves have similar behaviors, with the CMVM, which proved negative too, as is visible. Considerations: According to the documents that served as the basis for the new venture capital funds (public funded),57 they were based on EVCA data (see above) and considered that “insufficient venture capital volume to support entrepreneurship”.They also calculated the gap between € 292 million and € 659 million and consider that the leverage effect for each euro sold in the case of venture capital is € 5.9 (assuming € 300M needed). In the case of business angels, consider FEEI 100 €, in the effect is 4.54 € for each euro mobilized.That is, double the current amount made available through this type of instruments, starting from the premise that “it was considered at first reasonable to assume that high-growth companies created in the future (or newly created) should all be funded.”This would only be possible if the supply of funds were unlimited. In the case of Venture capital, assuming average, when the distribution is not normal is incorrect (or survival is rather low). Interestingly, it is to finance new companies to divest private equity in which it seems to be counterproductive because: The financing gap is being passed on to subsequent phases of funding; The surviving ones later have no financing, in fact to grow (to see for example that even the financing of the EIB, direct financing starts to appear below € 20m). If the market can not absorb or finance these types of companies, it will not make much sense to favor the use of a capital instrument when the capital market does not exist. On the other hand, if return on investment is required, the use of equity instruments is also counterproductive, as explained.
